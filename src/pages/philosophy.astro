            <p>Sovereign Engineering is grounded in the values articulated in <em>The Sovereign Individual</em> and embodied by Bitcoin: <strong>self-sovereignty, agency, and censorship-resistance</strong>. We build technology that maximises individual freedom, minimises reliance on trusted third parties, and treats the individual as the ultimate node in every network.</p>
            <p>From <a href="https://njump.me/nevent1qqsqm2lz4ru6wlydzpulgs8m60ylp4vufwsg55whlqgua6a93vp2y4gpzamhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuer9wfnkjemf9e3k7mgzyphydppzm7m554ecwq4gsgaek2qk32atse2l4t9ks57dpms4mmhfxjc476g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Fix the Money, Fix the Web"</a> we take the conviction that a sound monetary foundation is a moral imperative, and that Bitcoin's paradigm of extreme ownership demands equally sovereign applications. Likewise, <a href="https://sovereignengineering.io/nostr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our notes on Nostr</a> remind us that protocols, not platforms, will reclaim the vibrant, open experimentation that defined the early web.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Freedom by Design</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr show that careful engineering choices can hard-code freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, and financial freedom into the very fabric of a protocol. Our goal is to replicate this property in every tool we build, ensuring that no single actor &mdash; not even us &mdash; can revoke the liberties users enjoy.</p>
            <p>Design decisions therefore flow from values first: minimise dependencies, maximise verifiability, keep exit costs low. When the design is right, freedom is a feature, not a promise.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Distributed Cognition</h3>
            <p>No ill-defined problem was ever solved in isolation. By gathering bright minds in a trust-rich environment, we tap into what cognitive scientist John Vervaeke calls <em>distributed cognition</em>. Conversations on the trail often birth insights that no individual could have generated alone.</p>
            <p>Every Friday's demo is an epistemic checkpoint, forcing ideas to survive contact with the group's collective scrutiny. The six-minute limit keeps egos small, iteration fast, and honesty high.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Explorers of a New Frontier</h3>
            <p>Our logo is a ship for a reason. Bitcoin and Nostr open a digital ocean as uncharted as the Age of Discovery. We welcome builders who yearn for that &ldquo;wild and open sea,&rdquo; who embrace risk, and who delight in charting new waters.</p>
            <p>Like Shackleton's crew, participants must trust one another when storms hit, and celebrate together when new land appears on the horizon. The sea is vast, and so is the opportunity.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">In-Person, High-Bandwidth</h3>
            <p>The magic happens face-to-face. Six weeks of shared meals, shared walks, and shared victories forge bonds that bandwidth-limited Zoom calls simply cannot replicate. Trust is built in the queue for poncha, not in a Discord channel.</p>
            <p>Madeira's Bitcoin-friendly ecosystem (see the <a href="https://btcmap.org/community/free-madeira" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTCMap</a> or visit <a href="https://freemadeira.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FREE&nbsp;Madeira</a>) provides the perfect real-world playground to test ideas minutes after they compile.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Bias for Action</h3>
            <p>We prototype first, critique later. Imperfect code is welcomed if it advances the conversation. Novelty, experimentation, and rapid iteration trump premature optimisation.</p>
            <p>This bias for action produces tangible results: from <em>Blossom</em> to <em>ZapStore</em>, many cohort projects were conceived on a Monday walk and open-sourced before the next weekend. The world needs working code, not slide decks.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Guiding Questions</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 italic">&ldquo;No solutions, only trade-offs.&rdquo; If we must choose, we choose the trade-off that maximises individual freedom.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Are you providing <em>value</em> or are you merely capturing your users?</li>
              <li>Who can rug-pull you? Who can rug-pull your users?</li>
              <li>Can <strong>you</strong> rug-pull your users?</li>
              <li>What is the exit cost for your users? What is the exit cost for <em>you</em>?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Freedom Tech</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">&ldquo;Freedom Tech is rug-pull-resistant technology.&rdquo; —Gigi</p>
            <p>When design choices flow from first principles, you don't have to ask users to <em>trust</em> you. The architecture itself makes betrayal impossible.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Cypherpunks Write Code</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">&ldquo;The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.&rdquo; —Hal&nbsp;Finney</p>
            <p class="mb-4">&ldquo;Cypherpunks write code.&rdquo; —Eric&nbsp;Hughes. We write code that liberates. We test ideas in the open. We ship the future.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Solvitur Ambulando</h3>
            <p>Problems are solved by walking. Ideas crystallise on Madeira's trails, not in meeting rooms. Many of our best breakthroughs began with a stroll along the levadas.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Endurance</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">&ldquo;Fortitudine vincimus&rdquo; —&nbsp;Ernest&nbsp;Shackleton. By endurance we conquer. Building sovereign systems is a marathon, not a sprint. We embrace the long game.</p>

            <p class="mt-8"><strong>Re-invent the future.</strong> Provide an environment that fosters deep conversations &amp; collaboration so that we may solve hard problems for future generations.</p>
