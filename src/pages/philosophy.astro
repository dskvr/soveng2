          <h2 class="h3 mb-6">Philosophy</h2>
          <div class="content text-left">
            <p>Sovereign Engineering is grounded in the values articulated in <em>The Sovereign Individual</em> and embodied by Bitcoin: <strong>self-sovereignty, agency and censorship-resistance</strong>. We build technology that maximises individual freedom and minimises reliance on trusted third parties.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Freedom by Design</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin, Lightning and Nostr demonstrate that protocols can guarantee freedoms—speech, assembly, movement—through carefully chosen design constraints. We strive to apply the same moral framework to every new system we prototype.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Distributed Cognition</h3>
            <p>No one can solve ill-defined problems alone. By gathering bright minds in a trust-rich environment, we tap into the group&rsquo;s <em>distributed cognition</em>. Walking conversations, time-boxed demos and peer feedback keep us aligned and honest.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Explorers of a New Frontier</h3>
            <p>Our logo is a ship for a reason. Freedom-tech opens an under-explored frontier similar to the high seas. We seek adventurers—builders who yearn for the &ldquo;wild and open sea,&rdquo; willing to take risks and test ideas in the real world.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">In-Person, High-Bandwidth</h3>
            <p>The magic happens face-to-face. Six weeks on Madeira foster trust, serendipity and high-bandwidth communication that no online forum can match.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Bias for Action</h3>
            <p>We prototype first, critique later. Imperfect code is welcomed if it advances the conversation. Novelty &amp; experimentation trump polish.</p>

            <p class="mt-8"><strong>In short:</strong> We are building resilient, decentralised systems that empower individuals and chart new territory. If that resonates, join the voyage.</p>
