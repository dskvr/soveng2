            <p>Sovereign Engineering is a six-week, in-person &ldquo;un-hackathon&rdquo; held on the island of Madeira. Its sole purpose is to create the best possible environment for <strong>high-bandwidth ideation, collaboration and rapid prototyping</strong> around freedom-tech such as Bitcoin, Lightning and Nostr.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">The Weekly Loop &mdash; Walk • Show • Build</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Walk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Talk (Mon&nbsp;+ everyday)</strong> &mdash; Mandatory group walks (&gt;90 min, easy terrain, wide paths) designed to mix the group, spark free-flowing conversations and harness distributed cognition.</li>
              <li><strong>Show (Fri)</strong> &mdash; Time-boxed demo-day: 6-minute live demo &plus; 2-minute discussion. <em>No slides, no excuses</em>; you must show something that <u>compiles and runs</u>.</li>
              <li><strong>Build (the rest of the week)</strong> &mdash; Participants prototype ideas alone or in small teams, supported by peers. Imperfect code is fine&mdash;<em>novelty&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;polish</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Weekly Rhythm</h3>
            <p>The loop is scaffolded by a simple, repeatable schedule:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Monday</strong> – Orientation &amp; theme setting</li>
              <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – Participant talks (deep-dive ideas &amp; discussion)</li>
              <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – Hands-on workshops</li>
              <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Unstructured time (explore, hack, or hike)</li>
              <li><strong>Friday</strong> – Demo-day &amp; barbecue</li>
              <li><strong>Weekend</strong> – Group activities / long walks</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Why Madeira?</h3>
            <p>Madeira offers year-round mild weather, breathtaking trails and genuine Bitcoin circular-economy adoption (&gt;150 merchants). You can <em>literally</em> ship a prototype on Thursday and buy coffee with it on Friday.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Who&nbsp;Should&nbsp;Apply?</h3>
            <p>Experienced builders who resonate with the Bitcoin ethos, can code independently, and are eager to <em>explore the frontier</em> together for six weeks.</p>
