          <div class="content text-left">
            <p>Sovereign Engineering is a six-week, in-person &ldquo;un-hackathon&rdquo; held on the island of Madeira. Its sole purpose is to create the best possible environment for <strong>high-bandwidth ideation, collaboration, and rapid prototyping</strong> around freedom-tech such as Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr.</p>
            <p>This environment is powered by a relentless weekly cadence designed for exploration: <em>Monday&nbsp;Mornings</em> set the theme, <em>Tuesday&nbsp;Talks</em> provoke discussion, and <em>Wednesday&nbsp;Workshops</em> transfer hands-on skills. By Friday&rsquo;s Demo&nbsp;Day, every participant has completed an entire <strong>walk &rarr; talk &rarr; show &rarr; build</strong> loop&mdash;ready to reset and do it again the following week.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">The Weekly Loop &mdash; Walk • Talk • Show • Build</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Walk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Talk (Mon&nbsp;+ everyday)</strong> &mdash; Mandatory group walks (&gt;90&nbsp;min, easy terrain, wide paths) designed to mix the group, spark free-flowing conversations and harness distributed cognition.</li>
              <li><strong>Show (Fri)</strong> &mdash; Time-boxed demo-day: 6-minute live demo &plus; 2-minute discussion. <em>No slides, no excuses</em>; you must show something that <u>compiles and runs</u>.</li>
              <li><strong>Build (the rest of the week)</strong> &mdash; Participants prototype ideas alone or in small teams, supported by peers. Imperfect code is fine&mdash;<em>novelty&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;polish</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Weekly&nbsp;Captains</h3>
            <p>Every loop is stewarded by two rotating <em>Weekly Captains</em>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;one at the front of the convoy, one at the back.  Their first duty is to <strong>shepherd the walks</strong>: setting a conversational pace, choosing wide paths that welcome side-by-side chat, and halting the group whenever the line stretches too thin.  The Captains make sure every participant mingles, every voice is heard, and no one is left trekking alone.</p>
            <p>The role extends beyond the trail.  Captains time-box Friday&rsquo;s demos, keep Monday orientations on track, and nudge Wednesday workshops into hands-on mode when theory drags on.  By distributing these responsibilities the cohort practices the very autonomy it preaches: leadership is shared, logistics are decentralised, and the programme stays tight without feeling top-down.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Weekly Rhythm</h3>
            <p>The loop is scaffolded by a simple, repeatable schedule:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              {weeklyRhythmData.schedule.map((item) => (
                <li><strong>{item.day}</strong> – {item.description}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Why Madeira?</h3>
            <p>Madeira offers year-round mild weather, breathtaking trails, and a thriving Bitcoin circular economy. According to the open-source <a href="https://btcmap.org/community/free-madeira" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTCMap</a>, more than 150 merchants on the island already accept sats for goods and services, turning every café run into an instant field test.</p>
            <p>FREE Madeira&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;a local non-profit focused on Bitcoin education (<a href="https://freemadeira.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freeMadeira.org</a>)&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;supports the community with workshops, meet-ups, and an ever-growing merchant network. For builders, this means you can deploy an e-cash wallet on Thursday, then buy your espresso with it on Friday.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-8 mb-4">Who&nbsp;Should&nbsp;Apply?</h3>
            <p>Experienced builders who resonate with the Bitcoin ethos, can code independently, and are eager to <em>explore the frontier</em> together for six weeks. If the idea of demoing half-baked prototypes in front of peers excites rather than terrifies you, you&rsquo;re halfway there.</p>
            <p>You should also crave long, oxytocin-fuelled walks, thrive on rapid feedback, and believe that freedom-tech is the moral imperative of our time. Sovereign Engineering is not a spectator sport; it&rsquo;s a voyage for those who yearn for the vast, open sea.</p>
