  content: |
    Sovereign Engineering is a six-week, in-person program held on the island of Madeira. Its sole purpose is to create the best possible environment for **high-bandwidth ideation, collaboration, and rapid prototyping** around freedom-tech such as Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr.

    This environment is powered by a relentless weekly cadence designed for exploration: *Monday Mornings* set the theme, *Tuesday Talks* provoke discussion, *Wednesday Workshops* transfer hands-on skills, *Thursday* offers time for reflection and experimentation, and by Friday's Demo Day, every participant has completed an entire **show → talk → build** loop—ready to reset and do it again the following week.

    The program is **private and off the record**—a safe space where 21 value-aligned builders can think freely, experiment boldly, and ship rapidly without the constraints of public scrutiny. When you bring 21 value-aligned people together in a place that's super Bitcoin-friendly, beautiful, and allows for spontaneous creation, magical things are bound to happen.

    title: "Core Pillars"
    content: |
      Sovereign Engineering rests on five fundamental pillars that create the conditions for magical collaboration:

      **The Weekly Loop**: The relentless show → talk → build rhythm that drives momentum and prevents perfectionism paralysis. Every week follows the same structure, creating a metronome for creativity.

      **The Walks**: Three-hour weekend hikes that stimulate creative thought through "left foot, right foot, left brain, right brain" activation. Walking isn't downtime—it's moving R&D.

      **Friday Demo Days**: Where the rubber meets the road—every participant must demo working code every week, no exceptions. Aggressively time-boxed with 6-minute demos and 2-minute discussions.

      **Six Captains**: Each week has a dedicated captain who steers the ship, ensuring organic emergence rather than top-down direction. Leadership rotates, keeping the program tight without feeling top-down.

      **In-Person Intensity**: Being physically present on a remote island creates the commitment and focus needed for deep work. High-bandwidth communication, trust building, and ideation only work in person.

    title: "The Weekly Loop"

      The week acts as a metronome for creativity. Friday's *Show* sets a hard deadline that concentrates effort—every participant must demo something they wrote or prompted into existence themselves. The moment code compiles on stage it becomes shared reality. Over the weekend and during Monday's orientation the cohort *Talks*—walking Madeira's levadas, swapping critiques, and letting distributed cognition surface better approaches. From Tuesday onwards everyone *Builds* toward the next demo.

      **Monday Mornings**: Orientation and setting the tone. The first week introduces the concept, while subsequent weeks set course for new directions using maritime metaphors—we're exploring the wide, unexplored cryptographic sea opened by Bitcoin and Nostr.

      **Tuesday Talks**: Participants present slides, share ideas, and give talks. The weekly captain often leads discussions, and organizers share insights, especially in the first week.

      **Wednesday Workshops**: Hands-on sessions where participants teach each other practical skills—setting up Nostr relays, configuring Blossom servers, working with Lightning networks, and more.

      **Thursday Time Off**: A day for exploration, experimentation, or refining work. Madeira's beauty provides the perfect backdrop for reflection.

      **Friday Festivities**: Demo day starting after lunch, with 6-minute demos and 2-minute discussions, followed by a standing barbecue that encourages natural group mixing.

  - id: "walks"
    title: "The Walks"
    content: |
      Walking isn't downtime—it's moving *R&D*. The weekend walks are the absolute core pillar of Sovereign Engineering, designed for light to moderate 1-2 hour hikes at a comfortable pace where participants can walk side-by-side and have conversations without breaking a sweat.

      **Why Walking Works**: Research shows walking stimulates creative thought. As one participant put it: "left foot, right foot, left brain, right brain." The physical movement activates your whole being and creates the perfect conditions for free-flowing ideas.

      **Natural Group Mixing**: With 21 participants, the walks naturally mix the group. You'll have many different conversational partners during a three-hour walk. Two guides—one at the front, one at the back—ensure the group stays together by stopping every 20 minutes to enjoy views, take water breaks, and let everyone catch up.

      **The Alternative**: Contrast this with sitting around a long table for dinner—you'd have at most three conversational partners (left, right, front) and the group wouldn't mix. Walking creates the natural group formation and spontaneous conversations we need.

      **The Path Requirements**: The path must be wide enough so people can walk next to each other (not single-file), mostly flat so anyone can participate, and comfortable enough that you can talk while walking. The guides must keep the group together and stop regularly to let everyone catch up.

      The island's levadas, coastal paths, and high-altitude ridges offer constantly changing scenery—nature's own slide deck. Exposure to sun, wind, and ocean spray anchors discussions in sensory memory; participants can later reference "that idea above the cloud layer" and everyone knows the exact moment.

  - id: "demo-day"
    title: "Friday: Demo Day"
    content: |
      Nothing concentrates the mind like a live demo. Every Friday afternoon the cohort gathers to **show whatever runs**. Polish is optional, honesty is mandatory. The rule is simple: you must demo something new every week—either related to ongoing work or completely fresh ideas.

      **The Format**: Aggressively time-boxed with 6 minutes of demo time and 2 minutes of discussion. With 20+ demos, we take breaks after every 6-7 presentations, usually running three sessions. The day typically ends around 6 PM.

      **The Philosophy**: We highly encourage trying crazy ideas every week. It doesn't matter if it's half-broken or half-baked—just give it your best shot and show it on Friday. This prevents "strudelutions" by forcing thin vertical slices over speculative architecture.

      **The Celebration**: After demos, we have a standing barbecue (no pre-arranged seating) that encourages natural group mixing. Friends and family are invited to join, creating a bridge between the private program and the broader community.

      **The Impact**: Demo Day serves as a public ledger of progress. Six Fridays equal six checkpoints, creating proof-of-work encoded in weekly commits that prospective participants can review.

  - id: "in-person-off-record"
    title: "In Person, Off the Record"
    content: |
      This is a **private, off the record event**—a core principle that cannot be overstated. You cannot do proper thinking completely out in the open. You have to be able to think in private and communicate in private without worrying about the online mob coming after you for having a crazy, weird, or stupid idea.

      **Why Privacy Matters**: We want to build out in the open and care deeply about open source, but ideation and experimentation require a safe space. You only want criticism from people who are actually on your side—otherwise you might destroy a gem of an idea too early.

      **The Experience**: We've learned this through hard experience. Bringing outside people into the group too early destroys the dynamic and trust built over weeks. The private space allows for unconstrained thinking and the discussion of more radical ideas.

      **The Balance**: Once ideas are robust, they're exported to the open sea—published on Nostr, open-sourced on GitHub, or demoed publicly. The off-record space ensures critique targets the work, not internet clout.

      **Presence**: We encourage participants to be fully present—leave phones at home or put them in airplane mode. If an idea is really good, you won't need to write it down—it will stay with you or someone else will remember it.

  - id: "weekly-captains"
    title: "6 Weeks, 6 Captains"
    content: |
      Each week has a dedicated captain who steers the ship through that week's journey. The captain is the person who basically steers the ship through each week, ensuring organic emergence rather than top-down direction.

      **Captain Responsibilities**: 
      - Shepherd the walks: setting conversational pace, choosing wide paths, ensuring group mixing
      - Time-box Friday demos and keep Monday orientations on track
      - Organize Wednesday workshops and find time slots
      - Arrange rooms appropriately for different activities (talks, workshops, demos)
      - Give talks and presentations when appropriate

      **The Rotation**: By rotating leadership every week, the cohort practices the very autonomy it preaches. Leadership is shared, logistics are decentralized, and the program stays tight without feeling top-down.

      **The Exception**: One week (week 4 or 5) is designated as "time off" because the program is quite intense. We learned over time that we need this break.

    title: "Madeira: The Bitcoin Island"
    content: |
      Madeira isn't just a beautiful location—it's a **Bitcoin-friendly breeding ground** for the future. Thanks to the efforts of André and Free Madeira, there are 150+ merchants on the island accepting Bitcoin. It's so normal to pay in Bitcoin here that you don't even think about it anymore.

      **The Alpha Test Experience**: You can build a new wallet on Thursday, then go to the coffee shop on Friday and pay with the wallet you built yesterday. It works, and it's an amazing feeling. In some way, you can alpha test the future in Madeira.

      **The Filter Effect**: You can't just swing by and leave—you have to fly there. This creates a natural filter ensuring participants are committed to the full six-week experience.

      **The Environment**: Madeira is a volcanic island with subtropical climate, dark volcanic cliffs, and breathtaking topography. It's a magical place that allows for the spontaneous creation of new things and the spawning of new ideas.

      **The Community**: There are many Bitcoiners on the island, and the merchant adoption is through the roof. It's a fantastic place to run a Sovereign Engineering cohort because it's super Bitcoin-friendly and allows immediate testing of new protocols and tools.

      We're looking for **21 value-aligned builders** who know what they're doing and want to see more cool stuff built. We don't have any official requirements—we're very open and just want to be surrounded by people who are value-aligned.

      **The Ideal Participant**:
      - Experienced builders who resonate with the Bitcoin ethos
      - Can code independently and are eager to explore the frontier
      - Excited rather than terrified by demoing half-baked prototypes
      - Crave long, oxytocin-fueled walks and thrive on rapid feedback
      - Believe that freedom-tech is the moral imperative of our time
      - Want to build the future they want to see
      - Are willing to be fully present and participate in the full program

      **The Magic Formula**: When you bring 21 value-aligned people together in a place that's super Bitcoin-friendly, beautiful, and allows for spontaneous creation, magical things are bound to happen.

      **The Goal**: We want to see awesome stuff being built, expand the impact that freedom tech can have, come up with new ideas and protocols, test them immediately, and have a good time while doing it.
