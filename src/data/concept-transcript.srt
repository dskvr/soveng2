1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,920
okay so let's see if I can do this well it's starting to rain now which isn't that

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:32,440
nice but you know I thought I'll go for a little evening walk and talk about the

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,080
concept of sovereign engineering so it worked reasonably well for the philosophy

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,280
I spoke about the philosophy and the concept for 45 minutes and kind of

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,560
managed to extract that philosophy from this recording by just talking through

6
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:59,800
it and thinking through it and so on and yeah now I kind of want to do the same

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:10,760
for the actual nuts and bolts concept of sovereign engineering so I'm not sure

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:19,640
where to begin I guess the right question to ask is what are the core pillars

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:31,800
of sovereign engineering and as it is now I think the core pillars are the weekly

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:52,280
loop the Friday demo days definitely the walks so the weekend walks and potentially now also

11
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:03,640
the captains even though the captains are relatively new concept but again as it is now we have six

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:16,680
weeks and six captains so yeah maybe we can see this also as another core pillar definitely the

13
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:31,000
fact that it is in person so again that's another core thing and yeah I'm not sure how to best

14
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,160
structure the concept what I want to do is basically create a playbook like some slides or

15
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,160
some things so that other people can do the same thing and really explain why we think this is

16
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,440
so I already mentioned when I talked about the philosophy that the walks for example the weekend

17
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:00,920
walks are incredibly important because what we want to have happen is a free flow of ideas and so

18
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:14,200
the walks are kind of the best way we have found to have this free flow of ideas other activities

19
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,440
work as well but nothing works as well as the walks and one participant mentioned it that

20
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:30,200
like for some reason walking really stimulates creative thought as far as I know there's a lot of

21
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:39,480
research around this and one participant summed it up nicely as like left foot right foot left

22
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,760
brain right brain so it really activates your brain it activates your whole being and so what we

23
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:55,480
are aiming for is light to moderate walks that go on for a little while like it should be at least

24
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:03,000
an hour or 90 minutes at a comfortable pace where you can just leisurely walk you're not gonna

25
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,040
break a sweat it's not gonna be super steep and you can walk next to each other and just have

26
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,720
a conversation so that's what we're aiming for that's that's kind of again the walks are a core

27
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,040
pillar of the summer and engineering concept and so what happens usually at the walks is that people

28
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,080
really get talking and really open up and really play around with crazy ideas and they bounce ideas

29
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:39,080
of each other and what's also very very nice with the walks is that the group mixes quite naturally

30
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:47,560
so usually we have around 21 participants that's what we're aiming for and if you

31
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,160
do the walks properly then the group will naturally mix so you will have

32
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:03,640
many many different conversational partners during a three hour walk and the way to do this is to have

33
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,640
two people that really know what they are doing that know how this concept works one in the one at

34
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,600
the very end and one in the front and they have to keep the group together and the person in the front

35
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,000
the guide so to speak in the front has to stop every 20 minutes or so you know to enjoy the view

36
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,280
to take a sip of water and to wait for the group to come together again and once the group is

37
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,680
completely together again just start walking again and we we continue and then usually what happens is

38
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,320
that if you if you if you still have something to hash out with the people you just talked you're

39
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,920
gonna continue to talk to the same people and if not then it's a great opportunity to just you know

40
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,240
continue and get to know someone else and talk about something else with someone else

41
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,920
so that really really works but again you have to have two guides one in the front and one in the

42
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:06,440
end that keeps the group together and you need to stop from time to time to make sure that

43
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,080
everyone catches up and the group kind of comes together again and so that you have can have this

44
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,440
natural kind of formation this natural group formation and this you know

45
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,360
these natural groups form and these conversations form so if you contrast this for example with

46
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:35,640
a large long table where everyone just sits it doesn't really work like if you sit for two or three

47
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:42,520
hours and have a dinner you have at most if you're lucky three conversational partners the person to

48
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,200
the left to you the person to the right to you and the person in front of you and it usually doesn't

49
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,840
mix so you usually stay put and you get food and so on and so forth so this is not very conducive

50
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,360
to you know what what we want to do so we try to avoid actually doing that so so we want to do

51
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:09,240
kind of different activities and yeah shout out to a way slice for example Josh who figured this

52
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,840
out and he who is organizing the Bitcoin beef steaks it's a similar idea where yes it revolves

53
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,680
around food and so on but one rule at the beef steaks is there is no sitting so everyone just stands

54
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,160
and eats with their hands and so you it's a very different dynamic and it just mixes

55
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,320
way nicer way better and people just you just run into each other and you have this natural

56
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,680
group formation as well so this definitely works as well for you know what we are trying to aim at

57
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,720
which brings me to the next kind of cornerstone the Fridays the demo days so after the demos

58
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,280
we usually have a barbecue and again like we try to do it in a beef steak style so that everyone

59
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,080
kind of stands we don't have you know like pre-arranged seating or anything and you just you know

60
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,760
go to the grill grab some food people are usually standing around in groups and just discussing

61
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,920
what was just shown during the demo days and the demo days are absolutely crucial to the sovereign

62
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:15,240
engineering concept so every Friday you have to demo something and it has to be actually

63
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:24,200
working code did you wrote or prompted into existence yourself and the idea is to try something

64
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,440
new try a crazy idea every week basically and show it off at the end of the week it might be related

65
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,480
to something you have already been working on it might be something completely new but it has to

66
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:42,840
be like we highly encourage to show something new every day to try a new idea every week excuse me not

67
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:50,760
every day but every week and yeah that's kind of the most important day of the sovereign engineering

68
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:59,400
weekly loop or the Friday demo days so again the whole idea of the whole program the whole idea of

69
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:11,560
the whole concept is to have a space and the time where massive ideation and experimentation can

70
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:18,920
happen so bring the best and brightest minds together let them exchange ideas let them iterate on

71
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,120
ideas let them iterate on the things they are working on things they are thinking through

72
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,160
and if you have a crazy idea just write out just straight away implement it and show it to the

73
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,080
group doesn't matter if it's half broken doesn't matter if it's half baked just give it a go give it

74
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:45,160
your best shot and show it on Friday that's kind of the core of the concept and every week is the

75
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:55,400
same so we have this weekly loop of show talk build and so Friday is show time on the weekends and

76
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,640
during the walks and in between sessions that's where the talking happens again like the the hikes

77
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,520
are structured and the the things that we do on the weekends and the things that we do as like

78
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:14,360
group activities are purpose built to have free flowing conversations and to have this kind of

79
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,000
spontaneous ideation happen yeah in the philosophy section I already talked about

80
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,040
this to really cognition and how it was influenced by the work of John Reveke who talks about

81
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,680
tapping into this distributed cognition a lot and basically the idea of the logos is not new

82
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,000
at all it's basically you know like you never know where the conversation leads you and the

83
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,840
conversation if it is a good conversation takes on the life of its own and that's exactly what you

84
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,440
want to see so there's a lot of research on this there's a lot of prior work so we are not

85
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:07,960
reinventing the wheel we're just trying to facilitate all these things that I just mentioned

86
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,480
so

87
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,880
all right so I mentioned the walks which are the walking and the talking is

88
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,200
a core absolute core pillar of the sovereign engineering concept the Friday demo day is kind of

89
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:40,600
where the rubber meets the road and the rest of the week has some structure as well so every day

90
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,200
except for Thursday is structured so we have Monday mornings Tuesday talks Wednesday workshops

91
00:11:48,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Thursday is to the time off so Thursday time off and Friday festivities Friday is the demo day

92
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,280
and the barbecue and you know a little bit of a celebration afterwards that we made it through

93
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:18,840
the week so it's a very very intense six-week program and the what's happening on each day

94
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:27,720
should kind of be self-explanatory but I'm gonna go through the days a little bit in any case so

95
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,080
Monday mornings is a little bit of an orientation setting the tone of the week like the first week

96
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,160
I think is the most important one it's basically where people get to know the sovereign engineering

97
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:43,720
concept there's gonna be a little bit of an orientation a little bit of kind of explanation of how

98
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:52,680
this works what we expect how this is gonna go and every week on Monday you know we're gonna kind of

99
00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:01,720
set the direction and as I explained in the philosophy section there is we use a lot of metaphors

100
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,600
around ships and shipping so we want to ship software we want to ship products and the ocean metaphor

101
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:16,520
also works really well because it is a wide unexplored cryptographic see that we are exploring

102
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,160
or we are trying to explore so the space that is opened up by Bitcoin and NOSR the cryptographic

103
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:36,040
space if you will I'll find entity and money is what we want to explore so yeah each Monday we are

104
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:43,240
trying to kind of set course in some direction and on Tuesday we have talks so Tuesday talks

105
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:51,560
is the second day of every week and we want to give participants the chance to give talks and

106
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,720
present things so this is where slides are shown this is where you can talk about you know whatever

107
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,600
you think is relevant we the organizers might talk about some things as well especially in the first

108
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,480
week and as I mentioned before every week has a dedicated captain so the captain might give a

109
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:20,280
talk there as well the captain is the person who basically steers the ship through each week so

110
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:29,480
every week has a dedicated captain so we have six weeks and we have six captains there's one caveat

111
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:38,120
week number five is also time off it's like an off week because the program is quite intense

112
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:48,520
we learned over time that we need a week off and week five I think it is week five or is it week four

113
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,720
I'm not sure week four or week five is the week off it might be week four like the in the middle

114
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,600
basically anyway as you can tell you know like that's why I'm talking into the microphone because I'm

115
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,400
trying to write down and figure out the concept and we we didn't really do this yet so this exercise

116
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,560
is very much needed but anyway I mentioned the Monday mornings I mentioned the Tuesday talks

117
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:23,640
on Wednesday with workshops so Wednesday workshops that's where the hands on stuff is happening if you

118
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,480
want to show someone how to you know like set up a certain server that you use or

119
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,920
assemble a certain piece of hardware that you frequently use or if you want to show someone

120
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,120
something in terms of how to configure this how to compile this how to do this or that so we had

121
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:50,840
people you know like you know play around with machine networks play around with synchronization tools

122
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,640
play around with Noster Relays like how to set up your own Noster Relay how to set up your own

123
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,640
blossom server how to do all the things that we are interested in and if you are new and if you're

124
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,320
coming from the outside and if you know Noster is new to you for example or some aspects of Bitcoin

125
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,560
or Lightning or eCache are new to you the workshops are a great way to really get up to speed and have

126
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,000
some of the best people in the world teach you how to properly do this so again Wednesday workshops

127
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,240
those are the hands on hands on sessions and anyone can give a workshop the captain it's the

128
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:34,120
captain's job to basically find the slots and set up the times and let everyone know when

129
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:42,440
workshop is happening and we also you know we do our best to arrange the rooms in a meaningful way

130
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,640
so if there's talks the room will be set up for talks if there's workshops the room will be set up

131
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:56,440
for workshops if there's demos on Friday the room will be set up for demos so we rearrange the

132
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,520
surrounding accordingly to what we want to do all right so where are we?

133
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,200
Monday mornings I explained that orientation and so on Tuesday talks I explained that as well

134
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:17,320
Wednesday workshops I went through that as well Thursday time off again six weeks are in

135
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,760
Madera it's a beautiful place Thursday is some time to explore or some time to you know get

136
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:32,120
some experiments implemented or refine some of the things you're working on your choice and Friday again

137
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,840
is where the rubber hits the road Friday festivities Friday is demo day and we have demo day usually

138
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:47,000
starting right off the lunch and yeah we time box aggressively so it's usually six minutes of

139
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,360
demo time and two minutes of discussion time and yeah because if you do like 20 plus demos in

140
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,880
an afternoon you have to time box aggressively we take breaks after you know like six or seven demos

141
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,000
or so so we usually have three sessions of seven people or something like that and like three

142
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,760
sessions of seven demos and still gonna take a while it usually takes a couple hours and after that

143
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:19,720
we usually done like five p.m six p.m something like that six p.m usually and we'll have barbecue

144
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,320
and the barbecue goes on for you know as long as we wanted to so we'll have great food

145
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:33,400
Martaine is our chef and he you know cooked some some great steak and some yeah just tasty tasty

146
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:41,080
barbecue there's something for everyone and you know after demo day we usually also invite

147
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:47,080
friends and family and you know some outside people if they want to have a bite and kind of hang

148
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,320
out with the crew and discuss kind of what's happening here and so on but in general in general

149
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:00,680
and that's also a core part of the project of the concept so a core thing of the concept is that

150
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,920
this is a private off the record event I want to repeat that again because it is really important

151
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:13,640
that this is a private off the record event you cannot you cannot do proper thinking completely

152
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,280
out in the open like you you have to be able to think in private and communicate in private and

153
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:26,920
basically you know just you don't want the online mob to come after you just because you had a

154
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:34,200
crazy weird stupid idea so yeah we we want to keep the group close then together so we don't

155
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,800
want to have any outside people there is also always the risk of having having spooks or having

156
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:48,280
just straight up weird people and so on and yeah so so that's super important as well it's like

157
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:55,880
we we definitely want to build out in the open and you know like we we care deeply about open

158
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,080
source and the open source philosophy but when it comes to ideation and experimentation you have

159
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,400
to be able to to do it in a safe space so to speak like you have to do it with your peers you have

160
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:15,000
to basically in some sense you only want criticism from people that are actually on your side

161
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,760
yeah because otherwise you'll you might destroy a gem of an idea too early you know in the

162
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,520
you you you I think this is a really important part and in part also because we had some

163
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,440
bad experiences with bringing outside people into the group to early and those kind of things like

164
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,920
it just destroys the dynamic and it destroys the trust that was built over over the weeks and so on

165
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:50,360
so again private off the record event super important um because otherwise you can't do

166
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,200
any kind of unconstrained thinking in some sense if you're always worried that there might be

167
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:05,960
yeah well you know an enemy an enemy in the midst of us so to speak then then you you won't allow

168
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,920
yourself to to kind of go all out and and actually discuss some of the more crazy ideas that you

169
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:21,320
have and so on so yeah um well else what else is there to say

170
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:35,080
again to summarize it for myself the core pillars as I see them are the walks so they're walking

171
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:44,440
we can't walk the show talk build loop so the weekly loop is kind of the core of the concept

172
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:55,000
six weeks six captains that's another pillar actually be together in person for a long time

173
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:04,600
and don't kind of dictate what's going to happen top down but let it organically emerge

174
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,560
and kind of having a different person leading the group and leading the program for every week

175
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:21,320
really helps with that um yeah and kind of the whole concept is geared towards the free flow of

176
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:29,000
information ideation and experimentation that's kind of what we what we care about

177
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:46,280
yeah I don't think I forgot anything crucial we usually also do an opening

178
00:22:48,040 --> 00:23:00,440
ritual in some sense so we also want to go into each week with some intentionality we definitely

179
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:09,880
want to go into each cohort with intentionality so we usually do a reflective contemplative exercise

180
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,560
at the very beginning so I usually ask participants what they want to see built kind of have them

181
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:26,680
contemplate where they came from what annoys them what is like really broken in in their eyes

182
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,280
in like if they look at the internet from through their lands what's the one thing they really

183
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:43,880
want to fix and kind of also think long and hard about not only what is broken but also how could

184
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,440
you fix it so what is an actionable thing that you could do what is something that you could come

185
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,320
up with that would actually move the needle that would actually make the internet about a place

186
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,920
yeah so so that's usually part of the opening ritual and we have a closing ritual as well where we

187
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:10,520
kind of look back at the six weeks a lot of things can happen in six weeks and kind of contrasted

188
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:18,920
to our state of mind and our thoughts and where we were in the world six weeks ago at the beginning

189
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:30,840
of the cohort yeah I think that's kind of it

190
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,400
I might keep the microphone on a little longer usually stuff still comes up

191
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,880
at least it stopped raining so it's actually a nice walk now

192
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:04,360
yeah we we also want to encourage participants to actually be present with each other actually

193
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,640
being a moment don't be on the phone all the time you know actually spend time together actually

194
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:19,480
participate participate in the program fully be present fully go on the walks you know leave

195
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:27,000
your phone at home or put it into airplane mode or what have you and really hashing out

196
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,040
in the real world with real people and you know if the if the idea is really really good

197
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,520
you won't have to write it down like it will stay with you or someone else will like it will

198
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:49,000
stay with someone else so that's what we found usually so we try to stay away from too many

199
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,400
distractions sent too much online time and so on but yeah what else

200
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:15,560
I guess the fact that it is in Madera in a small like

201
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,920
island in the middle of the Atlantic is kind of important as well for two reasons so

202
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:32,520
you can't leave it takes quite a bit to get there so there is kind of a filter in terms of

203
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,840
if you want to come there you actually have to fly there there is no other way I mean you can come

204
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,480
come with a container ship but that's even more trouble so you can't just like swing by and then

205
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,960
leave again you actually if you want to participate you'll have to participate and we also

206
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,120
you know we we we will make exceptions for exceptional people if they only can come for like a

207
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,760
week or two but the point of the program is to stay for the full six weeks like you'll get the

208
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:03,800
most out of it if you stay for the full six weeks and what's amazing about Madera is not only

209
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:12,280
is it beautiful and not only is it like a laid back you know like it's a magical place kind of it's

210
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,760
quite topologically speaking it's just ridiculous it's a volcanic island subtropical it has all

211
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,600
these you know dark volcanic cliffs it has like black beaches um well one black beach I don't

212
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,840
I don't want I don't want to get the hopes in terms of beaches up too high um there isn't many

213
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:39,160
beaches there's two artificial ones and one or two like black ones but um well I love the place

214
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,080
it's a it's a it's a fantastic place to to live and to be and what's amazing about Madera is

215
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,440
that thanks to the efforts of Andre and free Madera and everyone who helps there like shout out to

216
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,200
Charlie who is onboarding all the merchants and so on um there is 150 plus merchants on the

217
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:05,000
island accepting Bitcoin and so that's quite something and just it's so normal to pay in Bitcoin

218
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,160
in Madera I pay my breakfast lunch in dinner in Madera basically you know every day and you know

219
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:18,360
like you go to the barber you paint Bitcoin you go to the dentist to paint Bitcoin you have really

220
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,080
nice dinner you paint Bitcoin um there's so many merchants that accepted it's such a normal thing

221
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,280
like I don't even think about it too much anymore and the reason why this is amazing is because

222
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,880
and we had this happen in in various cohorts people will you know build a new wallet or build like

223
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,720
crazy you can't have wallet or what have you or build a new nasa thing or when we came up with

224
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,280
nut saps you know like you can implement it and the next day go to the coffee shop grab a coffee

225
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,840
and pay it with the wallet you just you know built yesterday and it works and you just like it's

226
00:28:52,840 --> 00:29:01,720
such an amazing feeling to be able to do that and in some way you can alpha test the future in Madera

227
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,840
so not only like the goal of the of of sovereign engineering is to to build a future that you want to

228
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,960
see we want to help you build the future that you want to see and Madera is a fantastic

229
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,600
breeding ground because there's just awesome people there there's many Bitcoin us there and the

230
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:25,880
merchant adoption is just like through the roof so um it's a great place to run a sovereign

231
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,600
engineering cohort so I think that's quite important actually that if you want to run a sovereign

232
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,640
engineering cohort it should be in a place that is like super super Bitcoin friendly and just like

233
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,080
in the best case you can just you know go somewhere and buy coffee with Bitcoin and just again like

234
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:52,360
test the wallet you build yesterday and so on so yeah that's kind of a part of the concept as well

235
00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:03,560
like it should be like um in some sense the reason why it works I think is because if you bring

236
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:13,000
21 people together 21 the coins together with the that are value aligned then have to write value

237
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,880
set and they are in a place that is like super Bitcoin friendly and just awesome and beautiful

238
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,280
and you know allows for kind of

239
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,240
allows for the spontaneous creation of new things and the the spawning of new ideas then magical things

240
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,800
are bound to happen and yeah that's why we're doing it the reason why we're doing sovereign

241
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:49,560
engineering is because we want to see awesome stuff being built we want to expand the impact

242
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:55,080
that freedom tech can have we want to come up with new ideas we want to come up with new protocols

243
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,840
we want to come up with new ways of doing things we want to test them out immediately we want to

244
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:10,520
kind of you know have an iron sharpen sharpen's iron situation and we want to have a good time

245
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:19,640
while we're doing it so um yeah that's kind of the idea and it really works so it really works so

246
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:28,280
far we're gonna start with cohort number five very very soon so there's still a month or so left

247
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,720
a little over a month so if all of that sounds interesting please go to sovereignengineering.io

248
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:44,040
and apply for the cohort if we like what we see if we like what you've built in the past um we will

249
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:52,040
we will take you we will say yes to you so we are very open we don't have any requirements any

250
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:58,040
official requirements we just want to be surrounded by people and invite people that know what

251
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:04,680
they are doing that want to that are value aligned that want to see more cool stuff built

252
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:15,800
and yeah that's kind of it and with that I guess I'll take another breather not sure if I'll

253
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:28,760
switch off the mic yet but yeah I might leave it at that

254
00:32:45,800 --> 00:33:08,760
all right one more very final thought so it might be important to note that the concept is

255
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,560
of course not set in stone at all so it evolved with every single cohort in like 12 to 18 months

256
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,120
from now it might look a little bit different again but that's kind of what we landed on we had

257
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:28,280
the weekly loop from the get go so quite a few things did not change but we're still kind of figuring

258
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:36,600
out the best way to do this as we speak and so this shouldn't be seen as gospel but just as kind of

259
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,480
a snapshot in time maybe if you will so this is how we're doing it right now we know it works

260
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,960
we are very confident that it's going to work again for the next one and yeah as long as it keeps

261
00:33:49,960 --> 00:34:06,280
working we want to keep doing it so that might be an actual good place to stop
