1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
yeah let's just continue and let's do start ugly yeah so it's it was kind of leading into it yeah

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,640
good okay episode one is that's let me see let me see if everything still works

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,300
man that's good i'm having fun already so it's already working it's already working yeah yeah

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,640
we might even get an mp3 out of it okay yeah that's the goal so okay that's officially now episode one

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:41,280
okay that's correct fantastic good okay so yeah like like we said in the in the awesome teaser

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,840
which one the first one or the second one the second one the first official one um we we wanna

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:58,480
we landed on some themes basically and um one of them one of them was basically uh start ugly like

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,900
don't be afraid to ship whatever you have in some sense and uh why do you think that's important or

9
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,100
why do we or maybe maybe a follow-up question to that like why do you think are so many

10
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,620
so many deaths that we work with have hangups with that

11
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:22,420
i mean to me every time i ship something that i know it's incomplete uh alpha or whatever

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:31,420
it is a very vulnerable space um so a lot of it is just the the insecurity of i know i i could do

13
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,980
better but that's the thing that you can always do better right so given that that that um that way

14
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,520
of approaching the problem you will never ship um so you have to be there's no perfection right

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,940
yeah there is no perfection you have to you have to find the comfort in shipping something that you

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,320
know it's imperfect um there there is uh what's the ugliest thing you ever shipped

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,060
oh my lord uh that's a it's a tough question everything

18
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:09,840
um i oh yeah no i i know what it is i oh the tunnel with the echo is gonna be interesting

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,400
uh we're gonna make it they have to suffer so so so right now we're walking through a tunnel that is

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,880
dug into the uh into the shore of uh of the island uh so it's gonna be a bit echoey no it's gonna be

21
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:32,800
perfect we're gonna fix it in post uh you know so the the the ugliest thing i've shipped i was

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,100
accident i accidentally shipped the honeypot wallet uh because i was testing publishing stuff on on

23
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:49,400
substore so it was radically incomplete so there was complete stuff that was like for example if you

24
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:57,260
published an event with your so the honeypot wallet is um an ip60 a nutsack wallet uh and if you were

25
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,720
to publish a token and the publishing fail because you didn't have internet or whatever it didn't save

26
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,160
it locally or it didn't even retry to save the tokens so it was it's very much uh probably the

27
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,660
ugliest thing i've shipped but do you regret it or you still think it's the right approach

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:21,240
i mean get it out and deteriorate i i think it's always the right approach to ship something

29
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:28,660
especially if you if you say this is broken in these ways or you know in this super testing is

30
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:38,420
great at that yeah oh yeah super testing is the archetype um if you if you if you disclose that okay

31
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,580
this doesn't work or like this other part is broken or like the onboarding process of of the honeypot

32
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:53,200
wallet says you will probably lose all your money uh that you put here uh but uh but the the cool thing

33
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,340
is that if you ship something that is broken um it's much more likely that you will get bullied into

34
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:09,200
fixing it rather than if you just keep it local and say oh once i fix this bad i will aim for

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,780
perfection yeah and you'll get to the point where you will always find something that can be more

36
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:21,080
optimized you will always find something that could be nicer that could be yeah more closer to what you

37
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:29,000
think it should be um so you can always find an excuse to not ship um so i think not shipping is never

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,540
the approach yeah yeah no i agree i mean uh who was it i think it was david heidenmeyer hansen of all

39
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,340
people the guy who hated bitcoin starting in 2010 he changed his mind by the way he changed his mind i

40
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:48,180
like him a lot but i think it comes from him right happiness is shipping and so yes try to try to bring

41
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,340
it into a state where it's just like you can ship it as fast as possible like just basically it's the

42
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,320
super ugliest pre-alpha mvp and just ship it and i think i think to be fair a lot of people in our

43
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,120
space in the nostril space did that right like i remember the first version of nostril boat which was

44
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,420
like ugly as fuck and i was like oh my lord what is this but it worked and and they iterated and

45
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:14,100
iterated and now it's a you know like uh stuff works and it's everything is way better and all those

46
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:22,240
kind of things and um yeah i i was just surprised like we i think also the theme of course starting

47
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,340
ugly is very meta for this thing you know like it's gonna be uh we're trying to practice what we preach

48
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,900
but i think it's very important to make it real like it doesn't matter if it's beautiful it doesn't

49
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,060
matter if it's perfect once it's real that's what it's basically what you said as well it's like you're

50
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,340
gonna get you're gonna get feedback you're gonna be you know like bullied into fixing things and all

51
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,220
those kind of things and once you once you push anything out it doesn't matter what it is it

52
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,880
doesn't matter if it's software or a piece of artwork or a piece of writing or even an idea or

53
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,760
what have you then it's real then it's in other people's heads then other people know that this

54
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,700
exists and then it kind of takes a life uh it takes on a life of its own and and i think that's

55
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,720
that's why it's so important to just ship it out don't try don't try to you know like make it

56
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,000
perfect and don't it's it kind of it's not about you it's about the idea and it's about the thing

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,120
it's not about you and and the thing is that once the idea or the software whatever it is it's out

58
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,460
there it can evolve whereas if it's contained just within your computer just within your mind

59
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:32,020
the the uh the environment is not as aggressive it cannot evolve as fast yeah it doesn't have as

60
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,900
many inputs um and i i also think there's something to be said about the fact that

61
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:44,580
we are kind of we are our habits and if you get in the habit of not shipping oh absolutely then you

62
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,900
become a person that doesn't ship it's also you know about the the i don't know if it was a study

63
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,700
or whatever or i i have no idea but basically they they ran they had two groups of students and i think

64
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:00,780
it was like a pottery class or something like that and uh one group of students um got the

65
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,760
task of you will be graded by your masterpiece and you have like six months to make your masterpiece

66
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,820
and you can do whatever but at the end one masterpiece has to come out and the other group of students

67
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:19,120
was told it doesn't matter what you do you will be graded by the amount of pottery things that you

68
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,660
produce by the amount of whatever vases you you you push out and the group that did basically shipped

69
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:33,140
constantly they actually produced the masterpieces they actually like the the things were so much

70
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,280
better because it's just about you have to get into the habit of getting stuff out and and just

71
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,740
doing the next thing and getting that out and so on and so forth so yeah no surprise i i actually

72
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:51,440
experienced that very uh very much personally uh in the past few months or in the past year i mean

73
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,220
you started and abandoned i don't know so many more projects than everyone else combined i think

74
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,180
no but that's that's a what what so for example what happened with highlighter i think highlighter is

75
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:10,200
such a good example of what not to do because with highlighter i started with one idea which was your idea

76
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:18,620
uh the uh the um purple text orange highlights uh so i started with that idea and then it morphed

77
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,320
into this other thing and then it morphed into this other thing and it went through like like six

78
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:30,640
different different um uh products so different different value props um and it got to the point

79
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:38,940
where i rewrote the code so many times without actually shipping it because it was kind of in prototype

80
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:46,940
stage constantly it got to the point where i was i mean everybody that interface with highlighter is

81
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,000
confused on what the fuck is highlighter um and and even i was completely confused on what is highlighter

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,020
and and it's got to the point where i haven't shipped the the the code of highlighter in like

83
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,460
three different revisions so like the product that is live now the one that i that i have locally

84
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:13,160
completely different thing completely different thing but every time i think oh i need to publish this

85
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,640
why are you so afraid pablo i well

86
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:23,140
it's because it has an awesome domain that's why that's that's the thing right the stakes are very high

87
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:31,840
um no but but every time i think about shipping i think i haven't shipped for so long these codeways

88
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:40,580
that once i ship it must be a masterpiece it must be fucking perfect yeah and that prevents me from

89
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,280
shipping it prevents it says me ah you know let's just go and work on you from happiness because

90
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:53,380
happiness is shipping happiness is shipping 100 so we are also not perfect yeah no but i i find it

91
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:59,780
fascinating that i am the same person when i'm writing code on highlighter and i am the same person

92
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,840
when i'm writing code on on whatever it might be on on olas on ndk on on whatever it is yeah

93
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,660
but in in ndk i can cut a release just like that on olas i can ship just like that in highlighter

94
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,720
i i get like stage fright okay it's a big thing okay i see yeah yeah but but i think that's why

95
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,560
it's important that we kind of talk about all those things because we when

96
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,960
a lot of the things that are the right thing to do are actually also hard and i think we know this

97
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,820
from from the bitcoin world where uh you know like being self-sovereign for example it's actually

98
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,420
hard but you just you have to kind of it's like getting up in the morning and going for a run

99
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,780
or getting up in the morning and jumping into a fucking cold plunge or whatever it's like it's

100
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,320
hard every time you have to find ways to force yourself every time in some sense you know and

101
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,160
and i mean on the bitcoin side and that's also that's it's part of this experiment right now which

102
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,560
i hope we will land on some things on an ostracite that are condensed almost like memes like we have

103
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,660
in the bitcoin space right where it's like everyone kind of knows that shit is hard and it takes a lot

104
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,320
of responsibility but we landed on you know not your keys not your coins for example and all those

105
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,140
kind of things and everyone kind of there is a mutual shared understanding of how things work how

106
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:24,140
things should work and uh what is the implication of of this what is the implication of not your keys

107
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,640
not your coins it's the implication is actually you have to sit down and do the things and take the

108
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,780
responsibility of actually you know taking care of your stuff and all those kind of things and i think

109
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:43,360
on on on the nostril side my hope is that we land on a on similar things i care mostly about the

110
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,180
developer perspective like mostly about what does it mean to build in the nostril ecosystem it means

111
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,540
shipping something that's super ugly and super imperfect and very weird and very confusing and

112
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,340
just pushing it out the door and see seeing what happens it's like nostril is the testnet

113
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,640
i mean everything that happened so far shows this very clearly you know it's like there is no testnet

114
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,640
there's like nostril is the testnet just push it out and treat it as such

115
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:22,920
yeah very much so and i definitely agree i definitely agree that um landing on the on the memes uh on on this

116
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:29,760
knowledge um it's super important because it's it's hard and we've seen it even within cyber engineering

117
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:39,680
where we see the same people making the same category of mistake um and they don't have the words

118
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,040
like that's something that that i keep coming back to they don't have the words to explain

119
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,180
why that approach is wrong they just work on one approach they found find the limitations

120
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,660
the drawbacks of that approach and then they change to an approach that is different but it's

121
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,680
within the same category of mistakes and then they have to work for a few more months to reach the

122
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,780
same conclusion and it's just because they don't have the category of what is the mistake yeah yeah

123
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:12,580
yeah i i i but i i mean to be fair it's also i think hard and confusing if you come from a regular

124
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:18,060
you know client server architecture kind of everything is a rest api style of development

125
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:24,520
and and and kind of find your footing in the nostra way of doing things and there absolutely is a

126
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,100
way of doing things just like there is a bitcoin way of doing things and i i mean one of the

127
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,840
comparisons that we often um that we have been drawing over the last couple months is like

128
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,700
especially for example if you build a bitcoin product once you go down the path of uh of being

129
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,800
a custodian for someone else's money you're already you know like you're not only with like one foot in

130
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,700
hell you're already in hell 100 because you're gonna you know like everything that that that it

131
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,880
will bite you in the it's such a small decision basically in some sense you know like technically

132
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,000
speaking maybe or or or or it doesn't feel like such a big thing but it's like a make or break

133
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,840
decision it's it's it's if you if you want to actually don't turn yourself into coinbase like

134
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,700
if you hold if you hold money for someone else you're gonna be as shitty as coinbase down the line

135
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,220
there's no escape from that yeah the the success case of when you make that one bad decision

136
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:27,960
that one fork in the road the success stage is living a life that you were trying to live the

137
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,880
opposite of that life right like like i don't think brian armstrong wanted to run a compliance

138
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:42,360
department and uh uh a spying uh agency with chain analysis and all these things um yeah you have to

139
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,040
someone with a very large stick is at your door at all times you have to and it's it's super

140
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:55,500
interesting you you used to say a lot and this is a no solutions uh exclusive oh there's gonna because

141
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:04,860
you i i never told you this um but um you used to say a lot um that lean alden say i said at some

142
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,700
stage uh i think it was in oslo or something uh if you're a bitcoin company you don't you don't want

143
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,780
to hold your customer's case you don't uh you don't want to hold your yeah i love the code yeah

144
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,420
and i i remember at the time i was working on insect bunker yeah i told you it was a shit idea

145
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:31,300
yeah well but i mean yes yes so i had to go through like the whole process of saying oh fuck this is so

146
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:38,600
bad yeah this this could get ugly so fast yeah um and then finding the ways of shutting it down

147
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,680
in a in in the right way of shutting it down which yeah from my perspective shutting it down

148
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,600
meant yeah breaking it uh not saying that i was not going to work on that because i didn't want

149
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,880
other people to work on that because i i think it's just it's not a bad idea for me it's just a bad

150
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,280
idea yeah i agree um but it's a it's a very compelling idea oh you make it so easy for

151
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,980
everyone oh the onboarding is solved but that's the thing and i think we don't have we don't have good

152
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,320
um i mean not your keys not your coins is the closest we have but it's like the the you cannot

153
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,660
abstract this away meaningfully basically it's like if you freedom implies responsibility and you

154
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,880
you will need to be responsible uh on the bitcoin sign for your keys for example you know like you

155
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,400
need to be there's other things like there's there's similar examples where they're just again

156
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,880
like there is no solution like suko's triangle is a good one it's like naming there is no you can't

157
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,660
have handles in nostril without the trusted third party you can't have like at you know their gg

158
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,100
whatever it is and it it's it's impossible it's an impossible problem so there literally

159
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:47,860
it's a provable unsolvable problem so so there literally are no solutions and the the trade-off we

160
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,400
landed on with you know like nipple 5 and those kind of things it's like okay we rely on dns as

161
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,120
the trusted third party basically and again i think that all the verified services i also think

162
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,520
it's actually a bad idea because it's like it should be your own domain like that that would be the idea

163
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,960
but but anyway i think and also understanding it as a as a discoverability of how do you get to the

164
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,620
pubkey in the same way that dns is how do you get to the ip address exactly is it's not that is your

165
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,520
identity yes is your pubkey is your identity and you arrive to the to the pubkey via the nipple

166
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:25,020
file yeah and but i want to come back to the the quote of of linalden uh a bitcoin company doesn't

167
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,440
want to hold your bitcoin and i think it's it hits the nail on the head and i think that's what makes

168
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,520
it so different but it doesn't mean that bitcoin companies can't exist and it doesn't mean that

169
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,020
bitcoin companies can't make money you just have to think about things differently and i mean of course

170
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,420
you know there's like collaborative custody solutions and there's a ton of financial services that

171
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:48,640
actually do not need to hold your money for you there's still lots of things that you can do and

172
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,380
make money on and i think the reason why i go into detail with all of this on the bitcoin side because

173
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,400
i think that absolutely the same thing applies to the nostril side absolutely the same thing

174
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,820
it's it's not necessarily about money but it's like you can you can provide useful services

175
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,040
without holding your customers hostage yeah and i think that's what we

176
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,940
have to kind of really nail and and i think that's the the vision and the story we really

177
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,600
have to nail because it's actually possible and it's not like a pipe dream or whatever it's like

178
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,360
it's it's you can create something and build something that's super valuable that's super useful

179
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,540
and you can make money and you can do it without requiring anyone's permission and that's kind of the

180
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,540
story i want to tell and that's that's and and and i was surprised that a lot of developers

181
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:45,060
have a hard time seeing that and also have a hard time believing that and

182
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:51,860
to to stick with the theme of you know like starting ugly i think you have to take this leap

183
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,720
of faith and just go for it and try it out and iterate along the way because i can't tell you yet

184
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,140
like what is the cookie cutter recipe which we have for web 2.0 for example where it's like you

185
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,460
raise a bunch of pc money and so on and you do all that yeah exactly and you squeeze them and

186
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,860
like then everything goes to shit and that's kind of the cycle the web has been in so far

187
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,860
and i really think we can break the cycle i really think we can break the cycle all the platforms so

188
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,900
far everything that was great it all went to shit it all and i think it's it is because of the

189
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,120
monetization thing you know it is because you have to actually capture everyone and squeeze everyone

190
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,260
it's unavoidable it's unavoidable you just can't escape those incentives but but but but it's not

191
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,300
unavoidable unavoidable from a business perspective there is great multi-generational businesses there's

192
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,060
great multi-generational fucking restaurants you know where it's like this restaurant existed for

193
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:49,840
like 300 years and it's still like you know the whatever in in like some valley and they still make

194
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,940
great food and they still make a profit and i think we can do that in cyberspace i really think

195
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,980
we can do that and that's kind of what i want to you know like hopefully figure out along the way how

196
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,940
what is the recipe to actually do that and how can you do it without falling into all the dark patterns

197
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,840
that you know the current iteration of the web brought us yeah to me it's interesting because you can

198
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:21,600
you can build everything surrounding a noster but then if you try to to monetize in the in the old

199
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,740
ways you're actually just building uh a company in the in the legacy system it's just kind of maybe

200
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,800
like mines.com i think is kind of a if a it's a good example where it was kind of noster for a while but but

201
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:42,960
not really um we sadly we have many of those of those examples right now um of companies that are

202
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,200
kind of noster but in reality is a little bit adjacent kind of or turn like start out well and

203
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,440
then turn themselves more and more into noster in name only yeah exactly and and i think that comes

204
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,880
from from fear like if you think that your users are only going to choose you because they don't have a

205
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,840
fucking choice yeah that like what does that say about you coming back to the restaurant analogy

206
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,440
it's like you know all the users like all the all all the patrons come in and you just lock the door

207
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,400
and it's like you have to eat you know i'm only going to let you out if you if your bill is a hundred

208
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,840
bucks or higher you know like that's the that's kind of that's how the web currently operates it's

209
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:31,920
very weird but but i think and and that's the thing i i think we don't yet because noster is so so

210
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:39,200
nascent and even bitcoin um it's so it's so young that we don't have good examples because when i

211
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,800
when i've talked about monetization and noster a few times i get the question of can you point to

212
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,960
an example of a profitable company that is doing seven eight whatever number of figures it's like

213
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,360
no bro like we have like 10 users what are you talking about uh hey hey we have a strong circular

214
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,640
economy of like the same the same 20 people stepping around over and over again what do you

215
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:10,560
mean it's like flourishing um but but at the same time bitcoiners you know what you can point to you

216
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:17,680
can point to things actually making money and you can point to that in most other areas um like i i

217
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,080
always i i go to the value for value side and the artist and so on like no one on spotify makes any

218
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,120
money no artist yeah but if you switch to noster and you put your music in noster you will make

219
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,840
like 20 bucks a week or something in saps and shit and and it feels like nothing but it's like

220
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,360
10 000x when you get on spotify literally it's literally like for the smaller artist it's literally

221
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,880
like 10 000x it's like because they get absolutely nothing and i think on the on the business and kind

222
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,400
of monetization side i still think it's i kind of agree with you there's way too early to go too deep into

223
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,680
this um like how could we monetize and so on but the fact of the matter is that we have a lot of paid

224
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,280
services that actually do make money i'm not saying they're profitable but we have paid relays we have

225
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,640
you know like the paid media upload thingies and all those kind of things paid verification stuff and

226
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,760
so on subvertise me the plus of servers yeah yeah yeah i was surprised to get that and and so so money

227
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,440
is flowing through the system and it's not much yet but you don't i don't think you need a lot of

228
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,320
um kind of imagination to see where this could go with you know the user base a hundred access a

229
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,920
thousand access and so on and i mean we have all the room for growth in the world because like going

230
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,840
from 20 users to like eight billion that's a lot of percentage points you know yeah that's what that

231
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,440
was kind of where i was going that that bitcoiners into uh leaning to austrian economics and praxeology and first

232
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,640
principles thinking and all these things and then they tell you oh no you have to show me the point

233
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,280
to the to the example that works right now no you have to to extrapolate and you have to to imagine

234
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,160
um and you you have to to me it's all about like self-confidence you have to have the confidence that

235
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:05,200
you can create something so valuable that someone will be willing to pay without being forced to pay

236
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,320
yeah yeah uh and what do you what you say about the the artist and the value for value i i think

237
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:18,560
that is such a perfect example of um because the way i see it is we have all this busy money we have

238
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,200
all these uh just in in the legacy world um of companies that they don't really need to make a profit

239
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,400
uh you know is the cheap money keeps them alive and and the game they're playing is it's just it's just

240
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
it's just a different game they're not really trying to create utility they're just trying to

241
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:46,720
bump numbers right to just yeah just go get the um get to the next round um and the whole point

242
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,240
is to create a unicorn right yeah the whole point is to go well yeah now a unicorn is nothing like

243
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,760
unicorn is one bill yeah yeah you you you you want to sell out kind of the whole point is to sell out

244
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,080
exactly and i think that model just doesn't work anymore it's just that model will

245
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,640
die both in the legacy and in nothing will never happen um and i think the the the model that i mean

246
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,880
in some sense it's also very much found to easy money right in some hundred percent yeah yeah exactly

247
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,560
a lot of it exactly um it it it is only possible because of the of the cheap money yeah um and i just

248
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:27,200
don't see but i i see companies trying to create that same model to replicate that same model within

249
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,080
nostril and i just think that that will never exist i think it will be corners corners yeah i hope so i

250
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,320
hope so the the the picture i have in my mind i mean the the the kind of the slogan i i i try to

251
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,280
run with uh but i already got some bush pushback because it's it's like too too childish but it's like

252
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,240
you can create a lemonade stand in cyberspace and and and the reason why i like it is because you don't

253
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,160
need unless you live in canada or whatever kind of you know communist state you don't need a license

254
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,640
and you don't need a permission slip to open up a lemonade stand you could even be like you know

255
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,320
eight years old and you just get the lemonade stand going and you and and and it's also i think it's a

256
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,520
it's a nice metaphor because you don't know what this could turn into like if you're really into it

257
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,960
this could turn into a profitable business and kind of that's that's that's what i want to get out

258
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:27,040
there that like there is like probably half a million javascript devs right now that could start

259
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:34,400
something that produces a set flow and they don't know about it so i i just want them to know because

260
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,120
making money is awesome you know like capitalism is awesome and and and we have all the right tools

261
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,760
now i think to to actually do that and pursue that and i think uh coming back to the restaurant analogy

262
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,760
like a busy street with a an awesome restaurant on it is beneficial to absolutely everyone it's

263
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,960
beneficial to the street it's beneficial to the restaurant owner and it's beneficial to the

264
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,880
competition as well and and i think that's what we have in nostril that's why i like the the busy

265
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,400
street with lots of restaurants so much because it's like if you don't like it you can get up and

266
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,280
and leave and go somewhere else and i think that should be true across the whole nostril ecosystem if

267
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,280
you don't like your wallet use another wallet if you don't like your client use another client if you don't

268
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,760
like your relay use another relay yeah and so on and so forth and i think that's the right way to

269
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,240
think about it it's it's it's it's a win-win-win situation yeah absolutely and and the other the

270
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,040
other part of the coin i mean we are of age enough to remember when the internet didn't used to

271
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:38,240
everything look exactly the same yeah and when you are designing a product that needs to work for

272
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,440
pretty much any single person in the world regardless of their lowest common denominator

273
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,440
you must create by definition a mediocre product yeah you can't say i'm going to create this one

274
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,920
client that has that is very weird but these thousand or ten thousand or one million people

275
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,840
absolutely love it everybody else hates it and thinks it's um no you have to you have to create the

276
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,040
the same thing for every single person and it's it's so uncreative it's so boring it like the street

277
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,320
looks yeah it's boring by default by kind of by definition by definition yeah it's it's the difference

278
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,880
between a shopping mall yeah yeah yeah and it's just the the street yeah that's a good point as well

279
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,000
that's a good point as well and i i i mean we we spoke about these kind of topics a couple of of times

280
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
already so for me the same examples i used in the past come to mind but it's like you might be

281
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,040
the best person in the whole fucking town or whatever to create like an awesome chef's knife

282
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,640
and you might not have like the goal is not to compete with the whole world and take over like

283
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:50,480
the the whole kind of knife market of the world you produce the best chef knife in the area and you have

284
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,520
a lot of customers that really like you and cherish you and you make a profit and that's it and i think

285
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:03,040
i think we we kind of already have the same um for for for various things online basically it's like

286
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,960
you know like this the one little tool that one guy built a long while ago and your whole

287
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,880
workflow relies on it and you're one of the like i don't know 150 users that the thing has you would pay

288
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:23,440
a lot of money for this thing to exist in perpetuity and i feel like lots of deaths are they really suck

289
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,680
at monetizing that kind of and they suck at asking for money as well and they suck at i mean most value

290
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:36,160
for value people suck at at the ask part of it but it's that's why i i try to bully absolutely everyone

291
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:42,880
into um uh doing something as a lot of the free-to-play games did where it's like if you want

292
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,000
to buy the skin for like ten thousand dollars let them buy the skin for ten thousand dollars if you

293
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,680
love the game you're gonna do it there's lots of people that it doesn't have to make sense for you

294
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:00,000
it doesn't have to make sense at all but let the people support you in whatever way they they see fit

295
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,040
and also make it appealing and make it easy and so on and so the only person that listened to me so far

296
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,480
it was actually million from primal yeah and that's where the the whole legend and thing came from and

297
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,160
so on and it actually works so so he was very against the idea he was very against it very reluctant

298
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,240
but you know like it's i told him just ship it like what's the worst that can happen you know it's like

299
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,960
start ugly start small and just ship it push it out if if if it if it sucks and if you get blowback and

300
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,360
if it's like no one does it or whatever then just revert it and that's it and i think i think it

301
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,880
also it comes from a point of fear like you said before like a very similar fear of like why do people

302
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,760
not ship the things that they actually built yeah it's just just try it out and do those kind of

303
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,080
things and i think you know like if you've been embedded in in the wider gaming ecosystem like this stuff

304
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,160
works and i'm you know i'm not talking about the darker sides of gamifying everything and putting

305
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,840
gambling into things and so on because that's where it's you know can also go but i think that's

306
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,440
what patreon really showed and also substack really showed because the reason why substack worked is

307
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,400
not because they added paywalls which they did like years later the reason why substack worked is

308
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,400
because you want to support this journalist or whatever and they made it really easy to do that

309
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,280
and also they used the protocol as the delivery mechanism they used email as their as their

310
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,360
delivery and that's i think that's the recipe and most people still kind of don't believe in it

311
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,600
so i'm i'm frustrated about that but but we'll see i remember when a bit of a bit of a story but when i

312
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:49,360
started climbing um i i was climbing with who's now my wife and she could climb stuff that i couldn't

313
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,760
and she she would tell me dude your shoes are too big like you can't climb with those shoes i was

314
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:04,320
like no i just suck there's no way and she's like dude let's just go to like the store and and buy new

315
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:13,440
shoes and and the next day we just went and got new shoes and it was it was actually that simple

316
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:22,640
it was actually a retarded way and and that's it like but it's so easy to get caught up in your mind

317
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,160
and think you know it's got to be like all this complexity and all this finance financial engineering

318
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:35,200
and oh i will move this money here and i will like and sometimes it could be just the left side of the

319
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,640
curve approach is the right approach i mean ask people and kind of explain i think proton mail for

320
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:48,080
example did this well it's like uh which which i like as an example because it's also like the um

321
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,280
email was basically fully captured but we kind of turned the curve i feel like you know and there

322
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,920
was a need in the market and and and some people came and again like proton i think is the group is

323
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,600
a great example there's many others but it's like okay like it's not going to be free period it's

324
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,440
going to be we're going to focus on encryption we're going to focus on privacy but for this to work

325
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,080
like you're going to have to pay it's going to be that there is no other way like either you are the

326
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,720
product and we spy on all your emails and we you know ram advertising down your throat and so on

327
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,120
if you don't want that you're going to have to pay for it and it's the same for you know on the

328
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,040
nostril side for example it's going to be the same for media hosting and so on if you want to do a

329
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,400
youtube on nostril if you're and if you're a creator and your livelihood depends on that and so on

330
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:36,640
free hosting is kind of out of the question you have to figure out how to yeah because otherwise

331
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:45,040
otherwise like you know otherwise you are back to selling user data or going down the advertisement

332
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,120
route and all those kind of things and so i i'm going back to dhh i really like the the approach of

333
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,680
base camp and the stuff that they work on with yeah with hey.com they did kind of the same yeah

334
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,880
people were kept on asking oh yeah but how are you going to make money we are going to charge users

335
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:08,160
users for money and then we'll have money like what do you mean yeah what kind of question is that

336
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,960
but so many people would get hung up on yeah but how are you going to make money yeah well like dude

337
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,440
yeah yeah no absolutely but if you think about it the other way is the weird way it's just been

338
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,560
normalized by advertisement and by google yeah but the way of oh no no it's everything is free we're just

339
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,080
going to mine your data and that that is very complex that is very fucking weird yeah i mean

340
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,440
people we we kind of we kind of know all that but we it feels like we forgot and we have all these

341
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,600
sayings for a reason right like there is no free lunch there literally isn't like if you think there

342
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,080
is then you're being fooled and you're fooling yourself and you don't see the hidden cost and it's

343
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,840
the same it's the same same thing here and so i hope that yeah i i agree i think base camp got a lot of

344
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,520
things right and i think the next hang up is about open source how could i how could i make any money

345
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,920
if i open source the thing and like someone else could steal it from me and uh you know and then

346
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,760
everything is terrible what would be your answer to that i have my own answers uh to to me it's just

347
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:19,760
the the the a brand uh brings a lot of moat uh like i i see a lot of discussion around the the what

348
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,920
is your motive but the source code is and especially now with like ai and now everybody's

349
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:31,040
writing code with ai uh the source code itself i don't think is is what's protecting your the company

350
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:40,400
and the revenue the like i want to buy the stuff that i use from the people that that make it yeah

351
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,800
not from the people that don't really understand it that's from the people that copy it yeah okay

352
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,760
yeah yeah what is your answer yeah i i think i have multiple answers to that particular question

353
00:35:51,760 --> 00:36:00,880
i think what so again i think first of all it's the same issue that it's a position of fear

354
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:10,000
and i think if someone copies you they only copy the state they copy a snapshot of what is a process

355
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,960
and they cannot copy the process of developing the thing and maintaining the thing and running the

356
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,160
thing and so on and uh so why why is there only like you know we see it in all successful open

357
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,920
source software it's the same pattern the team that is actually building the thing has like the 99 of the

358
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,800
share of the forks in terms of what are the users actually running we see for firefox we see

359
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,120
see for thunderbird we see for wordpress all those kind of things and wordpress is actually a great

360
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,880
example of how you can think about building a business around open source software while the

361
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,280
full thing remaining open source at all times because running a wordpress instance is actually

362
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,640
work and so the service you can provide is um making it easy for paying users to run a wordpress

363
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,760
instance and you develop the software and so it all kind of goes together like this and so on

364
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,640
so i think there's i think i think it's a similar hang-up that the nft people have you're actually

365
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:13,520
not selling the jpeg you know you can't sell the jpeg it's like the jpeg is worthless it's like you can

366
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,400
you can copy it's not where the value comes from you can you can copy the jpeg at zero marginal cost

367
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,720
and it's true for literally every time it's rendered it has been copied exactly and and so the value

368
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:32,480
you and i think and that's why why i wanted to you know like continue these conversations and

369
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:41,360
explore this together because i think we as a society basically um are very confused about

370
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,720
what can you actually sell online and what can't you sell online because people are actually trying

371
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,840
to sell jpegs you know and they're like that's so fucking retarded it's beyond belief and so so

372
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,720
we have to figure out what is actually the thing that can't be copied what is the service that you

373
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,600
can provide and that's the thing you charge money on and so uh i mean we we we discussed this many

374
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:14,160
times in the past but for example if if if the thing you're you if this thing you're selling in

375
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,280
evolves compute you can sell that in a straightforward manner and the same goes for storage space which

376
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,160
is you know very similar to compute it's actually what are the actually scarce resources and most of

377
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:31,680
the things that are useful they involve something along those lines of a scarce resource and you can

378
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,040
monetize that the code is like it's that's not where the value is that's not that's not where you're

379
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:44,000
actually not selling the code like we you did i don't know like in 1996 with winrar or whatever

380
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,320
i feel like we learned all that but yeah i don't know i i again i think it comes from a

381
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,240
position of of being afraid and the position of worry and so on and i think that's not a good position

382
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:05,600
to be in i think you will if you actually build something of value and you actually have active users

383
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:12,160
and you have actually people that cherish your product you will be able to get monetary support

384
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:20,400
for that just because basically in some sense yeah i i i think it's one of the notes that we have of the

385
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,720
things that we want to discuss but i i think there is um such a thing as trying to monetize too early

386
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,320
as well as trying to monetize too late yeah of not thinking enough or of thinking too much about about

387
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:42,560
monetization um and particularly within within nostr i i i think within nostr everything like the right

388
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,920
approach we still don't know we we are finding it out uh we are exploring it if you try to say oh i'm

389
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:58,080
going to monetize right now via this way um and it's just copying how it's been done before you are

390
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,240
closing yourself off to new ideas there's an opportunity goes to the fact that you are going

391
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,800
for the uh oh i'll just put some advertisement on these products or or whatever uh i i just don't

392
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,240
think that's that's the um absolutely i i would argue even that we still don't know what steps are for

393
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,440
example yeah i completely agree like they're definitely not like just payments i think they're

394
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,080
also definitely not like just tips i i think they're also not just super likes or what have you and

395
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,320
all those kind of things and i think we can do a lot of stuff just by like we can do so much

396
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,720
exploration just by money seamlessly flowing through the system and that's very very much underexplored

397
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:46,240
but uh yeah we're so we're we're gonna continually explore it so that's the whole point of the whole

398
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,800
thing i think that might be a nice way to end the the first one i'm getting sunburned already and tired

399
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,200
so i'm like i know we're gonna start going uphill i'm very i'm very close to having a stroke basically

400
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,600
it's it's probably a great place to stop

401
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,640
but how did you think that was it useful maybe i think so for us yeah i think so i i i think it

402
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,160
it can be yeah we'll see we'll see what we'll see we'll see we'll see what we'll see we'll see what

403
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,320
people say we did it is the first episode after all yeah we we didn't talk about starcraft too much

404
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,080
so i apologize yeah yeah i mean obviously asleep right now

405
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,600
but yeah no we i mean i my my goal is to to continue to kind of pick your brain and discuss

406
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:37,440
these things and and hopefully hopefully going forward with uh um not too much inside the baseball

407
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,960
kind of you know like yeah i i really hope to open up the conversation uh and just bring like you

408
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,360
know random javascript developers in have no idea about bitcoin have no idea about how all this works

409
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,760
but uh maybe are attracted to you know like the making money part of it and are compelled to yeah

410
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:05,440
maybe as a last thought um um before we we we enter the hellish part um the the reason i think why

411
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,880
people should really care or developers should really care about nostr is that you as a developer

412
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,760
can actually not be rug pulled and that's a very underappreciated um kind of aspect of the whole

413
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,200
system because there's many people we should probably stop doing that there's many there's many people

414
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,200
that developed you know on top of the reddit api on top of the youtube api on top of whatever api

415
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,800
and then things change the company changes the api changes full rug pull like you know

416
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,600
business model change yeah all those kind of things and the the little app or thing or service

417
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,920
that you worked the last 10 years on completely like the foundation is it's a literal rug pull the

418
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:54,720
rug is pulled under you and and you're done for and i think you know like um if if our intuition is

419
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,920
right on nostr this this should never happen like you can actually build a long lasting literally

420
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,400
multi-generational business on top of nostr and i think that's very very compelling yeah we have

421
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,600
to figure out a ton of things still like we have to figure out like it's still very very imperfect

422
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,720
it's still ugly nostr started ugly we're still in the ugly face but i feel like we're getting out of

423
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:22,160
the ugly face and i think we we can um yeah have something it really feels to me like it it we have

424
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,120
the chance of building the next iteration of the internet and hopefully not repeat the mistakes of the

425
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:34,800
past yeah yeah absolutely uh to to me i've been on the on the indie maker community for decades at

426
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,600
this point and they're one hang up every single time it's never about the technique how do i build

427
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,800
the product that is never the question around the indie maker community it's always how do i get users

428
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,920
okay oh how do i do facebook ads because that's always the solution oh it's just run facebook ads

429
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,760
be very active on twitter reply to people it's always always about the distribution of your product

430
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,960
and in the in the indie writers community on fictional writers it's exactly the same problem you go to a

431
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,600
writers conference it's never about honing your craft it's always distribution how do i get distribution

432
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,280
and that is the one thing that nostr completely solves yeah completely you get it for free basically

433
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,840
you get it for free i i launched uh olas what was it like six weeks ago it immediately had users

434
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,360
yeah immediately had users it immediately had content there was immediately a reason to install the app

435
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,560
and to engage with the app yeah because there was something there it wasn't just dummy text or you

436
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,520
know reddit style make it till you fake it till you make it style it was actual content by actual people

437
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:49,120
yeah um and that is so powerful that is so powerful and is is is you're building on something

438
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:55,600
that like you said it cannot be why did singa work right they they singa built on top of facebook so

439
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:02,320
they they had the users but then facebook can fuck them of course immediately you are building

440
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,720
everything based on someone on someone else's land and they can take it away at any point with

441
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:16,400
enough so you get that is of course is way smaller than facebook and twitter obviously but you get

442
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,480
the same dynamics and i i think that if you if you extrapolate if you do the game theory there is going

443
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:29,840
to be more and more and we to me one of the things that shocked me um a few times already is companies

444
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:37,280
that have been at the social network game uh trying to create their own oh yeah trying to create from

445
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:44,400
which is fucking insanely hard yeah um already coming to nostril yeah and we have yeah a few

446
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,080
it's a very good example it's a very good sign yeah yeah we we have a few examples of companies that

447
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,480
are pre-seed nostril they they pre-date nostril and they are they are coming to nostril yeah to me that is

448
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:03,440
absolutely fascinating and that gravity only increases i agree i agree i agree awesome awesome fantastic

449
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:11,680
thanks pablo for suffering with me through those 45 minutes i think that was good so yeah we're gonna

450
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,920
try to do it again and yeah we're gonna ship it as soon as we can so that's the plan it's ugly we know

451
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,320
let's see let's see let's see if the recording actually worked and let's see if we if you can't

452
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:29,920
understand stuff but well let's hope let's hope that's fine that's fine that's fine no that would be

453
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:37,360
nice you're in the rocks we'll put everyone to sleep all right take care
