1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Alright, take two.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I told you this was going to be very imperfect.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we already fucked up the first time.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It was phenomenal.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The discussion?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The three minutes.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Absolutely amazing.

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Sitting on via Jeff was excellent.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So we can always go longer.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A weird Brazilian guy is to blame for all of this.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So what is this going to be?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is officially the second test recording slash teaser.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So tell me about it Pablo.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What is this going to be?

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, it's a bit of an experiment where we're going to try to distill what we've learned, where we are.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And yeah, I think we, because mostly because of what we did with sovereign engineering so far, we now know a lot more than we did a year ago about where people get hung up.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And it's just the mistakes that keep coming up constantly or repeatedly.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So I think we're just going to walk and try to explore.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, it's a nice excuse to have a nice walk in the sun.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's going to be my thing.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The reason why I'm doing this is I just want to have an excuse to see you once a week for an hour.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because even though we are more or less at the same place, we basically never see each other.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So that's terrible.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And yeah, I just want to pick your brain.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I just want to see where things are at.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I think you've been very close to Noster for a long time.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Probably closer than most.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I just, yeah, probably too close.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, careful.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't fly too close to the sun.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, but I, I, I, I mean, we talked about some of those things already.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And the last time we talked about it was like, we should actually record all this and just get other people involved and just see kind of how the conversation involves and open it up and so on.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And so we got because many in many of those conversations, we go in knowing less than we that we end up with.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We find out things while we are having a conversation as an exploration that we're having.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And I think we've arrived to many interesting thought provoking ideas, having those conversations.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And so we're going to continue and we're going to press record and we're going to just send it.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's going to be the idea.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, exactly.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's how that's how the internet evolves.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It used to be sent tweet, the secret to life and absolutely everything.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now I guess it's like send note.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I still hate it.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I mean, I should, I think we should reclaim.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, fuck it.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But now it's going to be sent podcast.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tolster.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, exactly.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And so that's what it's going to be.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And yeah, I'm a big believer in kind of, you know, that's why we, we also in the, in the cohorts, we force everyone to walk and talk and think out loud.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And so on.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And so that's, that's going to be an experiment in kind of, you know, I don't know.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Noster, development, dialogue, I think.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Something like that.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, let's see how it goes.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's see if that one worked.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Maybe we have to take a, do it take three.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We'll be loving something.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But yeah, no.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I hope, I hope we'll get something out of it.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm probably, we're probably going to do it mostly for ourselves.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I guess if someone listens via Jeff is going to listen.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We're going to, we just have to do, like, hashtag starcraft or something.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's going to be, it's going to be amazing.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's going to be a Noster and Starcraft, but exactly.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There, we'll see, we'll see how it goes.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And yeah, we'll, we'll see where our feet and our conversations lead us.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So that's the plan.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's the plan.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Awesome.
