1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
there we go i found an open source an open source voice recorder it actually works

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:15,080
all right i think that's it are we on yeah that should work all right i'll trust it again

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,540
which didn't serve me well so far every single time i said like i trusted something went wrong

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,880
and i had to do some manual recovery

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,480
but we made it that far

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,380
all right yeah let's just go there

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:46,760
and we'll we'll see where our feet and our conversation leads us okay so yeah i think

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,560
we both agree that the internet is fucked i really like the title that you gave one of your talks

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,080
which was the internet is fucked yeah i completely agree the thing is the internet is the best thing

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,320
that we've ever invented and it's so fucked because our expectations were so high about it

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:14,660
i remember this from my youth and childhood when the overarching theme was that the internet is going

12
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:23,240
to be this massive intense uh technology that's going to unite us and elevate us the human spirit

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:30,680
will reach a new level and the sphere free access to information free access to knowledge

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,640
free everything at your fingertips yes and like uh kind of a uprising of the human soul

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,620
yeah to the powers that be yeah and and now we have memes and porn and misinformation memes porn

16
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:51,500
misinformation violence political manipulation crazy people finding each other on the internet

17
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,820
starting cults yeah i mean i think as i as i'm getting like i don't want to say as i'm getting older

18
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:07,120
but looking at how things turned out and i become less disappointed about it at the same time though

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,440
so i'm kind of finding my peace with the developments that we've been seeing because

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,400
maybe um i think maybe our expectations have been a bit too naive about how things going to work out and

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,300
maybe just maybe the things that we're seeing now as the internet perpetrates or penetrates the entire

22
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,840
world the frictions that we see that you just mentioned maybe are just part of the process

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,600
and you know it's like you know a child expecting like the the gift and then you get the gift and

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,720
you realize it's not like what you imagine it to be yeah but you still get something out of it and

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,520
you only when you grow up you see that it was something actually towards that goal that you

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,940
anticipated and i'm kind of thinking maybe for example misinformation or cults or just you know

27
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:05,740
the crazy people finding each other maybe that's an unavoidable point in the path on the path towards

28
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,700
this original vision what the internet would have brought us you know yeah i mean i think it's also

29
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,240
it's also good that crazy people find each other i mean we found each other on the internet as well

30
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,440
correct i mean we're also crazy people but it's it's the the thing is that um you know it's always

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:30,820
a two-sided coin or a you know like a uh uh what's the saying with the sword yeah double-sided

32
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,720
double-edged sword double-edged sword that's right yeah and and so you can't have the good without

33
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,160
the bad and i think all all the wisdom traditions will tell you this as well you know and that's what i

34
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,140
think is that i think that was the main mistake that the early internet people they equated

35
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,580
information with knowledge and with wisdom and those are three very distinct things like if you're

36
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,220
lucky you get from information to knowledge and if you're very lucky you get from knowledge to wisdom

37
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,180
but but it doesn't come just because and it doesn't come for free and i think we were very naive

38
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,000
and what i kind of hope that i mean in some sense we're trying to build the next version of the

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,220
internet right now in some sense yes and what i'm worried about is that we're going to make the same

40
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,100
mistakes so i really hope that we're not going to make the same mistakes and so i don't want to be

41
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,640
utopic about you know bitcoin and oscar and e-cash and all those kind of things because it's not

42
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,140
going to be utopia i i mentioned i mentioned as many times already but i really like john riveki's line

43
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:37,640
neither nostalgia nor utopia so so both of those are misguided we have to learn from the past and

44
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,640
extract the good things from the past and kind of aim for have a utopic vision in some sense but we're

45
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,600
never gonna have any utopia ever and i think that's where the early internet people they got a lot of

46
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,840
things right like net neutrality for example um which of course you know it's debatable whether we

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,660
still have that and so on um but i think they got a lot of things wrong as well which which was kind

48
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:09,460
of you know being convinced that we will usher in the utopia yes and i mean looking back at the

49
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:17,820
cypherpunks the cypherpunk movement itself uh defined itself through uh making everyone aware of the

50
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,580
terrifying world that we could end up in if the internet if the world digitizes and we yeah we become

51
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:33,380
more connected it's not a utopic vision per se um it is even stronger i think i would say is the

52
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,240
dystopic vision is the thing that you're trying to avoid the insights that speaking of things trying

53
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,640
to avoid i was like let's walk here i'm sure there isn't it's going to be it's not going to be that

54
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,440
noisy and there's like you know a jackhammer like it's it's really terrible instruction everywhere

55
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,880
so let's see these mics they are pretty good all right so that's closed off anyway so fuck it let's

56
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,160
turn around because i wanted i wanted to to get up there but everything's closed okay so that's

57
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,300
construction let's just for the listeners this is uninteresting we're just turning around in circles

58
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,700
basically walking in circles that's gonna be the the future of the internet it's like

59
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:18,940
so the long arc of history is getting back to the to the warnings the early warning signs i think

60
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:27,260
like they're also in bitcoin you'll find some of the i think interesting voices uh made us aware of

61
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,780
the dangers of a hyperbitconized world for example oh yeah not everything should be purely optimistic

62
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,860
you need to think about what happens let's say if nation states adopt bitcoin and uh use it

63
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,540
as a weapon to oppress their own people yeah it can be it's not like just because the tech is there

64
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,020
everything will turn out fine yeah there is the the the idea and the fundamentals of the tech are the

65
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:58,260
most important i think we all agree on that but obviously the way it's implemented is a whole like

66
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:05,220
it's it's undefined until it's done yeah yeah yeah and i think it's it's i mean that's a

67
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:12,420
that's just kind of by definition always true you know it's but i flip flop on this because it's like

68
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,160
you know it's just a tool technology it's just a tool it depends on how you use it and so on and you

69
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,720
have i don't know let's let's take nuclear power you know like you can have uh clean abundant energy

70
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,480
forever and you you have nuclear weapons it's the same tech kind of you know you have a great kitchen

71
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,920
knife it's like you can murder someone with it or you can cook a great meal and and and so so the

72
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,160
technologists will tell you that technology is neutral but the reason why i flip flop on this is

73
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,220
is because i feel like there's some technologies that aren't neutral like reading and writing for

74
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,640
example i don't think are like it's it's i don't think it's super neutral in some sense or i i don't

75
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,520
know i'm again i haven't made up my mind on this yet but the the reason why i bring it up is because

76
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,760
i think the

77
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,540
there is such a thing as a certain ethos embedded in various technologies like the car for example

78
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,020
there's there's there are arguments that that personal transportation is what in part would

79
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,420
brought out the brought down the soviet union because it's basically it's hyper personalized you

80
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,580
know it's like you can go anywhere you just you fill up your car and you can go anywhere it's it's

81
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,820
freedom technology in that sense you increase the ability of people to move you increase agency

82
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,680
you increase agency and that's why why i i brought reading and writing as well because

83
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,960
reading also increases agency in the sense that that it expands your horizon and it expands your

84
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,060
knowledge and those kind of things and i think i think it's undeniable that there is a certain

85
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,600
ethos embedded in bitcoin for example and it truly changes people i mean i've seen this over and over and

86
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,100
over again and it changed me as well and like that's why lots of people wrote about this and and i think

87
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,800
that's this by now this is a known fact and so that's why i'm not sure if technology if all technology

88
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,840
is truly neutral in some sense but i don't know so my my the reason why i bring all this up is because

89
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:09,560
i my hope is that we can have a kind of and i'm not even sure if technological is the right word like

90
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:16,780
i was about to say that we can have a technological substrate that brings more agency and thus also more

91
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:23,080
responsibility to society but i'm not sure if it's the right word it's like i mean there's a reason

92
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:33,020
why we go through great lengths to you know to to the things we have to do so that almost everyone

93
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,980
in society can rewrite it's like insane it's insane it takes like years and years and years of education

94
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:45,580
it's like our whole society is geared towards this you know towards literacy and numeracy and so on

95
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:52,160
so so we obviously think that this is valuable and we obviously think that this is beneficial

96
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:00,620
to everyone and and and so with the with the internet right now for example we don't do anything

97
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,400
like that and someone just a couple days ago brought up an excellent point that the current where the

98
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,600
internet is trending right now with internet with tiktok and all all this bullshit it's completely

99
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,520
passive it's like i'm here now entertain me yes give me all the recommendations even like amazon

100
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,860
shopping is like that you don't even you know go out to look for the thing that you need you're just

101
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:30,440
like yeah please dear algorithm tell me what i need on average the agency of the individual

102
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,200
is on average is reduced at the number of people with higher agency probably increases but as more and

103
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,840
more people use the internet we ended up in a point where most people are pure consumers that was

104
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:52,260
always the case that most people will be consumers but um i think we both can agree that

105
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:59,740
the morality of the question whether something is good or bad only depends on the human itself

106
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:08,800
technology itself just can never exist in a pure vacuum it has no meaning in a pure vacuum it always

107
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,020
needs to be applied for human and whether it's used for human good or human bad depends on the

108
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,960
individual situation i think we we can all agree on that so the the thing itself is neither good

109
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:27,480
nor bad i'm i'm a strong proponent of stoic philosophy and stoic philosophy basically dictates

110
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:36,180
that also technology and everything outside of your control has no moral meaning the fact that it can

111
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:44,100
be used by a totalitarian regime to control its people and the same technology can be used by the

112
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,100
people to topple the totalitarian regime shows that very very distinctly very obviously

113
00:11:49,100 --> 00:12:00,080
yeah yeah i like the i like the stoic thought uh you know basically it's it's it's it's in in eastern

114
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,740
philosophy as well right where it's you know if if you can do something about it then do the thing

115
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,520
and stop worrying about it and if you can't do something about it then worrying about it won't do it

116
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:23,380
any good right same same thing but yeah i i mean my my hope is kind of that with what we've learned

117
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,900
now from the current iteration of the internet and i i view i view i mean this is still all ongoing

118
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,800
and it's like you know ai is like proliferating and everything is algorithmically driven and it's

119
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:42,300
kind of it's in some sense i hope that we'll build stuff that allows those who want to

120
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:49,460
position themselves in the driver's seat to be back in the driver's seat and actually have a say

121
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:56,300
in kind of what happens to their money what happens to their compute what happens like how they

122
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,800
like have agency in cyberspace basically yes and increase the number of agents also like yeah we will

123
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,540
always there will always be something new that enables those who adapt it first to gain more

124
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:14,740
power and influence and what i find interesting is all the technological breaks that we encounter on

125
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:23,820
the way um sometimes equal the playing field again yeah right now it's ai it doesn't i mean it's

126
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,380
ambivalent i think because you can see that the larger companies that were you know uh developing this

127
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:37,260
technologies such as google amazon maybe apple as well they have a head start yeah but at the same

128
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:44,720
time the models are getting so much faster and more efficient that suddenly like thousands and

129
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,560
thousands of new people can build products that really rival those big ones yeah you know that's

130
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,020
the best thing that can happen that's like that's the that's really the best thing that can happen

131
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,580
because there is no other moral direction as we have discussed before there's no ai is not going

132
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:08,500
to be just good yeah but we can increase the chance of it being good by making sure that more people have

133
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:16,140
access to it and more people can use it to fulfill their dreams and their goals instead of like the few

134
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:22,560
one company dictating already have their goals already know where things need to go to to benefit

135
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,940
themselves yeah yeah yeah i think it's it's interesting to watch this happen over and over

136
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:38,260
again that that kind of uh you know like the the cost gets driven down and and also the open models now

137
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,080
catching up and stuff gets smaller and easier and cheaper and that means more people can use it and

138
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,120
have access to it that's the most exciting thing and the same thing happened also with bitcoin yeah

139
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,960
absolutely the banking system the entire finance anything that has to do with money like literally

140
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,740
anything from payments to saving to whatever you want to come up with 15 years ago there were maybe

141
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,400
like you know hundreds of entities in the world that could do those things yeah now we have hundreds

142
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:10,600
of thousands of people who can build this and deploy this and just go with it because of bitcoin

143
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,560
because we have like completely equalized the access to financial systems to find to financial

144
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,480
operations on the internet and we're going to see the same with intelligence hopefully like actually

145
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,220
like i'm so impressed with by what's happening one year ago i remember this very clearly that i said

146
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,040
to someone it's like i don't think that we'll be able to build uh you know that we'll have

147
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,380
competitive on-device ai because of the big of this huge gap between large data centers and the local

148
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:48,100
llms that people have been using one year ago and this has changed now like a couple months ago i was

149
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:56,000
telling someone else the same i did the same uh wrong prediction by saying now we're in this regime of

150
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,400
um excuse me what is called like the the thinking models um the ones that you know first produce

151
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,700
uh the chain of thoughts that's that's what it's called like chain of thoughts models and then you

152
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:15,180
make the actual uh synthesis of data yeah and i was like convinced this is a new paradigm this is going

153
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,860
to you know win over the old paradigm which turned out to be true now everyone does thinking models but i

154
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:28,920
thought because it uses so much energy local llms will never be able to compete with large data

155
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,780
centers that now offer this uh you know prediction time compute basically uh that that requires so much

156
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:43,640
compute during prediction and deep seek v3 just came out you know a month ago and just shattered that

157
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,180
prediction again so it's like this force of equalizing is the most the strongest force

158
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,360
that that that i can think of it really like on an economic level forces everyone to rethink

159
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,800
what they've been doing and adjust to the new status quo and i like that's why i'm so in love

160
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,340
i mean technology that's that's what that's what free markets usually do right but but i i feel like

161
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:11,600
not every technology works like that and not all systems work like that and i feel like we have to be

162
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:19,440
i briefly uh touched with this on on on pablo in one of the conversations um that we have to

163
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:26,200
be very careful to distinguish with stuff and systems that gets better over time which is what

164
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,980
you just described it gets more uh you know more democratic to use the term over time more people

165
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,900
will have more access and so on and other things that have a centralizing tendency that centralize

166
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:43,540
over time and can get kind of worse over time it's like um i don't know i feel do you see it in a

167
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,120
similar way or do you think it's always going to be kind of nature works in a way that it's it's

168
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,800
automatically tending towards the good no i don't i don't think that it's uh it's an automatic thing

169
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,840
there are systems that get you know that benefit from centralization some things just scale better

170
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,980
when you centralize them and that's like the opposing force to what i just described

171
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:13,420
um and network things are very good examples of that social networks are like the best example of

172
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,400
that it's it's known as the network effect yeah the more people participate in a network the more

173
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,360
valuable the network becomes that means like inherent to the way this system works means that competition

174
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,540
is really hard to bootstrap you can make a social network with your five friends but it's not going to

175
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:37,280
do anything sure i mean that that was the that was the bane of uh like every single time uh bitcoin

176
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,300
has tried to move away from bitcoin twitter it didn't work because of network effects i think we're

177
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:47,580
now now with nostr it's the first time where it has a chance of working yeah and i agree and uh with

178
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:55,380
nostr we've we've kind of unlocked one thing that the closed systems will never be able to unlock

179
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,400
because they cannot cooperate in their they don't have synergies in their dna they must compete yeah

180
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,280
this is the only thing that keeps them alive yeah is the competition they must steal each other's

181
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,680
uses from each other forever because they cannot transition into a different model yeah many people

182
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,360
have tried that it's why jack dorsey left twitter at the end yeah it's why so many protocols in the

183
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,500
past that were supposed to be adopted by you know the large players for example facebook or meta

184
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:29,260
adopted 80 proto uh for for their instagram twitter clone whatever it's called and it's like it's

185
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:35,760
irrelevant no one interrupts with them no one even you can't you kind of just with blue sky like the

186
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:44,040
same to to you know mention the b word it's it's if you if you need like uh billions of dollars to run

187
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:50,940
one node then no one will ever interrupt it's like it's it's not an open it's it's open in name only

188
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:56,140
right it's like you you need you need so much money to run the single master node that is required of

189
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:02,880
the system that you just can't it's just like you know try joining the the swift node banking system

190
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,820
you know it's like yes it's it's you can in theory but you need like billions of dollars and we are

191
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,520
doing it with noster we are literally doing it with not with noster it's like my same nsec i can use it

192
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:21,220
to stream videos i can sell stuff with shopster i can use it as my wallet on noster i can like i can

193
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,980
do so many things with the same identity now and all of these systems benefit from each other yeah

194
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,400
because they have not been founded on this premise of becoming the big thing yeah none of these

195
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,040
small subsystems of noster want to become the only thing that is around because they kind of

196
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,140
you know they know that noster will fail so their entire system will fail if they are the only thing

197
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,400
yeah right so even like let's take primal as an example primal is like the most walled garden

198
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,860
experience that you'll get on noster and it's also sometimes makes compromises you know on on

199
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:02,120
decentralization and whatnot like people know that but even primal knows exactly that if only primal is

200
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,460
used at the end of the day everything else breaks yeah none of their business models will work out

201
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,200
like we've we've found the system in which synergies are rewarded yeah exactly it's the same thing in

202
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,320
bitcoin like i look at the bitcoin space and i see all these different companies and i've never seen

203
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,660
this in my life before we are all in the same boat you can feel that people think that they're in the

204
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:29,900
same team you have competing companies that produce for example like two wallet providers that both

205
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:39,700
compete for number of users maybe like but both of them know that they both improve the bitcoin

206
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,800
ecosystem with their products yeah and everyone's working on the same mission bitcoin fails we all

207
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,900
fail yeah i think i think that's a perfect way to put the incentives out there it's new it's never

208
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,900
been done before it's so exciting to witness this yeah no i think i think that's what what the

209
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:02,960
the the current like platform style building of internet systems is like it's it's it's pure

210
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,060
competition basically without any any symbiosis and we had no underlying substrate that allowed for

211
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,840
symbiosis no and i think if you look at nature like the the most successful systems are symbiotic

212
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,260
systems it's like nature is full of symbiotic relationships that's what a lot of the you know like

213
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:26,920
uh i i feel like a lot of people gloss over this fact that it's not all the jungle is not all

214
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,740
like competition competition and like only the strongest will survive and all those kind of

215
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,720
things i mean in that case we would have probably only one single species left at the end of the day

216
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:47,480
like if that were the case yeah no i i i i but i think coming back to the you know stuff gets better

217
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,800
over time and stuff gets worse over time uh what are your thoughts on what still i feel like is the

218
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,340
main criticism in in bitcoin especially from outsiders but also also like some some people

219
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,720
that know a lot about bitcoin will tell you that you know mining is centralized lightning will centralize

220
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,980
over time uh um like cashew is a terrible idea because who will run the mints and we'll only have

221
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,720
a couple of big mints that they will be like banks or what have you what's your what's your response to

222
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,760
all of that i mean um i let's steal minute for a second uh with lightning i think we have a good

223
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,340
example of a system where the network effect again plays uh has a strong strong effect on how the how the

224
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:41,640
system develops in you know this in network theory the stronger hub becomes the more efficient the system

225
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,940
becomes right so there is an incentive to centralize in lightning this is just simply

226
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:54,100
true and we've been seeing it and you can measure it in in lightning and you see it happen but the the

227
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:03,660
the important point in lightning is that it allows you to participate in the system without asking for

228
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,780
anyone's permission yeah and i know this phrase is being said over and over again permission that's lost

229
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:13,460
its meaning yeah it's being said over and over again but i just want to you know make this more

230
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,300
concrete and uh how this and make this more concrete and show how this specifically applies to lightning

231
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:28,780
as as an l2 system also different from others lightning is the only thing that we have that invites

232
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:35,440
everyone to join without signing up anywhere so you can spin anyone invites anyone anyone anyone's

233
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,140
join we know mathematically impossible to invite everyone yes correct like if i said everyone then i

234
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:49,840
need to correct myself there so um lightning is the only decentralized layer two system so even if

235
00:24:49,840 --> 00:25:00,880
the the incentives drive it slowly towards decentralization uh sorry drive it mildly to centralization

236
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,460
that means that doesn't mean that you cannot run your own node and connect to the system and

237
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,620
offer an alternative to a subsystem or something like that i think there is also an important

238
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:18,720
difference between a centralizing force and a monopolizing force right because if you fuck up

239
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,940
you're dead immediately and someone else will take your place and that's not true in the monopoly

240
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,880
but even if you're the biggest player and so on oh my lord we're good we're almost getting run over

241
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,900
we're actually getting run over by a truck we are still alive all right okay thank you

242
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:42,800
so yeah this is this is the exciting thing about recording a podcast in the wild that's why that's why

243
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,140
that's why most people uh are are pusses and build a studio and hide in the studio no no we don't need

244
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,200
they can't take the the jungle of the street

245
00:25:51,200 --> 00:26:00,700
but yeah i think i think that's an and the reason why i want to have all these conversations is because

246
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,040
again i feel like we are missing the vocabulary the right way to talk about those things because

247
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,260
there is a big difference between between centralization and monopolization there is a big difference

248
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:17,980
just like for example like just two days ago we talked about um custodians and so on and it's the

249
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:24,640
first time i i stumbled into the phrase of a blinded custodian a blinded custodian is distinctly

250
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,240
different from a regular custodian and i think i think just having that word just having that phrase

251
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,540
blinded custodian makes it so much easier for me to talk about those things and think through these

252
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,500
things and so so i i think you you hit on something let's take the example of cashew there

253
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:48,340
uh because like that's kind of that was the dream for such a long time is okay so we have custodians

254
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,900
we have blinded custodians we can talk about the specific meaning of the blinded custodian later

255
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,520
but you know an e-cash system with a blinded custodian that offers you great privacy

256
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:06,420
with a single entity that gives you that service let's say a bank a one single bank would

257
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:13,360
would develop like an e-cash system and provide this for their users that bank could fuck up it

258
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,900
could blow up it could fractionally fractional do fractional reserve and then like all its users

259
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:27,640
would be you know left holding the bag for example so it could just break very easily what we have

260
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:34,500
tried to do and what i think we're we're really you know achieving at this point is to allow anyone

261
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:42,080
to spin up an alternative system if they want cashew is super easy to deploy and it really like the the

262
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,540
only thing that you need is a lightning note and you can become uh you can spin up a custodian or a

263
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:53,040
service and offer it to all the users what we've done like none of the cashew wallets out there

264
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:58,340
assume that you're going to use a single mint yeah for example all of them kind of assume that there

265
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:03,400
will be many different mints and you can connect multiple mints to your single wallet and that's

266
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,420
exactly what we've been seeing like there are 30 to 40 different mints out there run by people and

267
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:15,700
like some of them will blow up some of them will fractional reserve some of them will rock their

268
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,060
users i'm sorry there's like no way to prevent it it's a custodian system but the thing is like there

269
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:26,820
are 39 different mints out there still alive yeah and even if that happens like a small part of the

270
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:32,700
system breaks but the entire system keeps growing yeah and like that's what we're trying to achieve

271
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,140
like even and it's the same principle everywhere right like if one bitcoin note goes down it doesn't

272
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,200
matter if one lightning note goes down it doesn't matter if one computer on the internet goes down it

273
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,120
doesn't matter and so on and so forth yes and i think that i mean that's what to my mind the the

274
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,260
whole nostril architecture it's so simple and so ingenious because you just default you default to

275
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,880
you default to you know a couple different relays and and you just blast everything out to like five

276
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,740
six different ones by default and so if one goes away even if it's a big one you don't even feel it

277
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,760
it doesn't matter at all i was just asked this this like yesterday this question about like what

278
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,080
happens if that if that relay goes down and my answer to that was it's like you won't even notice that

279
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,540
the relay goes down it's like you have eight relays or ten relays in your client yeah i have no

280
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:25,220
emotional connection to my relay if it goes down whatever man i'll just use the next exactly and

281
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:31,300
and you can have that again relays are not necessarily blinded in that sense but but they

282
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,680
don't have any real power over you and that's what we we discussed when we said like it's it's like the

283
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,460
data is bearer you know like you sign the data and it's almost like if you if you if you look at

284
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,920
storage for example you can have a blinded custodian when it comes to storage because you

285
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,960
can you can just split stuff up and encrypt the charts only knew what's there and and like okay

286
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,360
i give you my hard disk whatever you store there i cannot even know that's also how a lot of the

287
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,520
modern you know email providers and so on work where it's just like the provider doesn't have the

288
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,160
keys to access the data so they don't know what's going on they just they just provide the system and i

289
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,160
think that's a again i feel like we're we're we're missing the succinct vocabulary to talk about

290
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,300
these things because that's a very very different power dynamic um than what we've had previously

291
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,860
where you know like your email provider reads absolutely everything knows absolutely everything

292
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:26,560
and if the government comes and and and and says you know like oh you have to get mr snowden off

293
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,320
your platform or something then then exactly those are like two different and very important things

294
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:37,160
to distinguish there as well you have one is the service provider that either knows what's happening

295
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:43,300
and can therefore individually sensor in the users or course individual users and the second thing

296
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:50,000
is that the provider itself could be forced to to censor an individual or rock an individual so

297
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,740
uh the state might from like from external information that the state has acquired about a certain user go to

298
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,560
that provider and say just stop this provider if you have a blind system then neither the provider can

299
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,300
uh rug you specifically nor can it be coerced to rug you specifically exactly those are two different

300
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:15,780
things that the the provider can protect itself from and the user of that provider can protect and it

301
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,300
makes a big difference because then it's like an all or nothing like if if if someone with a really

302
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,320
large stick knocks at your door and tells you okay we have reasons to believe that you know like

303
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,420
problematic person is using your system then you have to you would have to shut down absolutely

304
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:34,520
everything for everyone yes and that's what what like uh i mean if you know your i'm sure you do

305
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,240
but if you know your cypherpunk history it's like with love a bit you know it's like okay a problematic

306
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,080
person used uh love a bit email provider uh please hand over you're you're legally obliged to hand over

307
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,740
all encryption keys all everything and so you know the absolute legend of the guy printed everything out

308
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,280
with the printer and as the printer was printing the keys he shut down and nuked everything and that was

309
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,640
the end of love a bit so a little bit of history for everyone here fantastic that's how but then

310
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,820
then you at least kind of you know you have a way a meaningful way to protect your users basically

311
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:16,780
and you have a meaningful way of of also kind of um you don't want to have all the liability on your

312
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,500
shoulders and i think that's what we what we see now happening with the next iteration of the internet

313
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:27,500
so to speak it's user data in general is a liability yes it's absolutely it's treated as an asset with

314
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,180
the current platforms people to step in and provide services for others yeah it's like you have to be

315
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,940
afraid of you know knowing too much about the people that you serve absolutely so the way to protect

316
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,780
yourself is to apply cryptography so that you cannot know anything and you cannot hand over anything

317
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,680
and you'll be in a much better spot if if things go south exactly and and the reason why i say like

318
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,320
i think this is what we see happening now because for some businesses and for some people um user data

319
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,380
is an extreme liability and that's of course you know like um vpn providers and those kind of things

320
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,380
and so the first people naturally that uh accept bitcoin accept lightning and so on is something like

321
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:14,800
a mulvat vpn or obscura vpn or silent.link and so on and and i think this will continue to happen like we

322
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:21,820
we will see continue this adoption will continue to happen at the edges where you absolutely do not

323
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:27,760
want to know anything about your users so you will accept e-cash for example it's just like here is your

324
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,680
user id you pay that's it and that's all the service needs to know about you i want to go one step deeper

325
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,640
because we're talking about the internet right and like i like our theme it's it's a bit like a fractal

326
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,860
but we're trying to trying to keep it like focused on you want to go from the internet is

327
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,800
fuck to everything is fuck everything is no but like one good example that just came to my mind when

328
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,520
you said this was i want to talk a bit about internet infrastructure i think that's that's

329
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:01,020
something that we talk so little about because we have almost like almost no power as users oh yeah

330
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,680
yeah yeah run your own isp yeah run your own fucking email yeah yeah try that you know and

331
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:12,460
if you run your own isp and there are very brave individuals who run their own isp and offer this

332
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:18,760
as a service to their local community for example local city and so on like if you can know which

333
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,320
every isp that uses standard techniques kind of has to know who uses your your service who the

334
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,560
individual users ip addresses are what services they connect to then you're going to run into

335
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,980
into problems that's why it's like scary to run an isp yeah and like there are countries where you

336
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,140
cannot host a wi-fi for example it's a very simple problem that many people know about you have a cafe

337
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:48,840
and you host a wi-fi like you become kind of responsible for what happens on your wi-fi because

338
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,820
because people people can just point towards your cafe and say like something bad happened at your

339
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,340
cafe and now you're responsible for that figure out who did that and hand me all overall

340
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,420
information like we're still at the very very beginning of what we could do there and i think one

341
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:11,860
example of how we can fix this is you know exemplified through tor and many you know similar techniques

342
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:18,900
that try to kind of use encryption and other techniques to to hide user data and again like running

343
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:25,660
a tor relay that takes you know data from the tor network and and relays it forward to the tor network

344
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:32,300
is super safe it's like you can do it at your home it's there is almost nothing that can happen to you

345
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,520
the data is encrypted just because you don't know who sent it and you don't know who where it's going

346
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,720
and you can run a tor relay that's no problem the problem with tor relays rather is like the entry

347
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,280
node and the exit node again the points where someone can point to and say now you have to hand over the

348
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,920
data or you're responsible for this kind of traffic that flew flowed through your node so i think in in

349
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,400
terms of internet infrastructure now when we go down the stack really really down the stack and even to

350
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:06,220
the hardware level we haven't even started that process yet that we've been talking about with you

351
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:14,940
know social networks and money social networks being noster money being bitcoin the all services all

352
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:22,860
infrastructure that we rely on is still in the hands of the of the you know powerful isps because

353
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:32,340
we haven't developed yet alternative ways wherein like an uncle jim isp can just spin up a network

354
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:38,000
for their for for their community for their village or something like that and be protected himself

355
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,080
not have all the liability of everyone using that infrastructure i mean to to to be fair like to be

356
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,840
fair to to our society and civilization uh pre-cryptography all of this was impossible

357
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,180
because we had to rely on authority like there was no other way to to build these systems and scale

358
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:01,940
these systems and so on and i think uh also like i'm convinced and i i have very technical reasons

359
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,580
for that i'm convinced that bitcoin is the only solution to like proof of work is the only solution

360
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:14,740
to um again i have this big talk and thing about uh cryptography is not enough so you still need

361
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,860
like an arrow of time in cyberspace and you need an authority that that you cannot get with

362
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,680
cryptography alone and bitcoin provides this with proof of work and you basically like it's a long

363
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,220
long long argument i'm not going to go into it but i'm convinced we need this we need this this

364
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,140
substrate and the only way to build it out um we need entropy in cyberspace and we don't have

365
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,560
entropy in cyberspace and bitcoin provides entropy in cyberspace and the only way to provide it is

366
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,700
actually with proof of work provable randomness that's what you mean yes yeah and but but that's

367
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:47,060
also how you build up an arrow of time like you need provable randomness to build up an arrow of

368
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,820
it's so interesting because also you know in in physics itself the definition of the arrow of time

369
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,960
it's the same thing no that's why i'm convinced it's the only way like physics works in the same way

370
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,480
all physical laws are symmetric in time and the only thing that is asymmetric in physics except for

371
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,980
like symmetry breaking or crazy quantum and or fundamental physics is entropy basically space

372
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,360
time emerges out of entropy delta s always larger than zero yes and and and and so so so we now

373
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,420
know kind of you know i mean that's where everything's heading uh space time emerges out of entropy out of

374
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,600
irreversible processes and all those kind of things it's the same we need the same in cyberspace

375
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,320
so and that's what bitcoin provides and so so it's a it's a long-winded way of saying kind of

376
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,500
we have to also forgive ourself and forgive society and forgive the banks and everyone else

377
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,800
and the ice piece and so on it was quite impossible to build that up um i mean you know this as well

378
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,280
like pre-bitcoin it was quite impossible to build all this up same with e-cash you know having large

379
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,260
scale deployed e-cash systems on top of fiat would be an improvement yes but it's kind of you know it's a

380
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,620
band-aid it's like it's bitcoin really makes it work as we've just said before it's like it's going to

381
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,140
be jp morgan who builds this and it will be offered to jp morgan's clients and that's it

382
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,720
and if jp morgan goes down the whole system goes down yeah like without bitcoin you cannot do this

383
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,600
in a meaningful way you need the underlying substrate that's actually fair and open to everyone

384
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:17,560
and provides kind of a you know to have a marketplace you first need physics you first need an actual

385
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:23,320
substrate where you can build a marketplace on and that's kind of how i see it and and i think

386
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,760
i think it's all going in that direction as you mentioned where where we have we can actually

387
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,760
build those systems out now where you are kind of zero knowledge about your customers and you are

388
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,920
zero knowledge about certain things and we see this now with tollgate for example you know it's one

389
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,800
of the one of the experiments currently going on where you basically you you you use e-cash to pay

390
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,500
for internet access and in this way the you know the mini isp basically your local isp

391
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,060
doesn't know anything about you can't know anything about you and and that's fantastic because it's

392
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,660
actually it it allows for an equal playing field in terms of who will actually provide the best

393
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:03,500
service can we just please for a second appreciate this wonderful fact that you can finally pay for

394
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:09,660
things online without having to kyc yeah i know i like i mean we're both hardcore bitcoiners and we

395
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,380
kind of sometimes forget about the hey this guy recognizes us as bitcoin bitcoin is great

396
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:24,660
so you know there is so much stuff on the internet that you could purchase and buy and like

397
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:32,680
many also privacy improving technologies vpn as the best example like the only way to pay for a vpn

398
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:39,500
was a kyc credit card for the entire existence of the internet and again there are technical reasons

399
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,280
there are technical reasons for it there are technical reasons you needed you needed bitcoin

400
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,120
before you before you could fix that because because before that all it's so funny that like

401
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:58,100
in the white paper it says electronic cash you know it says electronic cash and in my mind the

402
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,140
electronic says already something about the whole system because you need to push electrons around to

403
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,860
make the thing work so so so the proof of work stuff is kind of embedded in the title it's not digital

404
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:14,080
cash that's why it's so distinct from cbdc and so on and and and in the digital world purely digital

405
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,240
world if you remove electronics if you remove proof of work you're immediately in credit there is no

406
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,840
other way to do it it can be just a representation of like exactly because there is no link between the

407
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,200
the physical world and the digital world yes and so you always need a trusted authority to resolve any

408
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,880
conflicts that will inevitably arise and so so if you have digital money it is credit money period

409
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:42,240
and credit implies identity and implies thus kyc because i need to know who you are because if

410
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,740
there are conflicts or the credit goes bad then i need to find you with the police in my back you

411
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:53,520
know that's that's how it works and that's why if you pre-bitcoin if you bought a anything like a

412
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,780
a domain or a vpn or what have you you had like you had to use credit rates there was no other way

413
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,840
it's it's it's like once you truly understand this stuff it's like okay okay that's but now we have it now

414
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,300
we can actually rebuild it and build it properly absolutely and the thing is like this is a

415
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:17,600
like a slight philosophical take but we see these very obvious truths only when the alternative is

416
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,720
presented to us yes yeah like this is something absolutely that that thought was almost worthless

417
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,420
yeah insight was almost worthless without being able to point to the alternative yeah and today we

418
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:34,100
can see like we can just say as like a lemma yeah credit means you need a gun yeah without guns

419
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,700
credits credits doesn't work yeah it doesn't scale or what what have you like you need to

420
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:45,780
at least kyc and in order for kyc to make any sense you need a gun because like what what benefit do you

421
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:50,160
have to know that joe owes you money if you can force joe to pay you back basically it's all about

422
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,540
enforcement in the end then yeah and that's the neat thing about bitcoin it does the enforcement for

423
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:00,400
you and that's still true on lightning so that's i think that's why that's why it allows anyone to

424
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,100
participate anyone to participate because you don't need a lawyer you don't need an army

425
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,360
like to actually be your own bank in bitcoin and have a self-sovereign monetary policy you don't need

426
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:17,620
a standing army that's kind of a big innovation let's tie it back again i'm trying so go ahead

427
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:22,940
in terms of e-cash no no you're you're great i love listening to you i'm sure everyone everyone

428
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,780
else does as well i derail every single conversation you you tend to sometimes

429
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:36,020
go on a tangent you go ahead no no like let's get back to the internet and why the internet looks

430
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,860
like it is today and i think this is also something that both of us have thought about a lot

431
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:47,900
is the way that the internet developed due to a lack of being able to finance itself yeah i think the the

432
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,400
word here is micropayments it sounds like a small part you know a small feature of something but

433
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,940
when you look into the history of micropayments and what people wrote about it and so on it kind of

434
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,680
it's not just about you know paying your coffee and being able to make a transaction with low fees

435
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:14,860
it was seen as the way that this cyberspace like the the electronic sphere that uh that is built

436
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:20,340
that is kind of finding a way how the electronic sphere itself can finance itself from within

437
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:26,680
you want we see that you cannot offer a service for free it's just everything takes resources so

438
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:32,360
you need to refinance it some way and the early visions of the internet thought that we are going

439
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,480
to find uh a way like you have talked about this with pablo in the last episode about 402 that was

440
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,240
kind of added as the error code and then you know we'll find a way to to to make payments in a

441
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,720
couple years and then we'll we'll be able to use that error code yeah it was kind of baked in into

442
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:55,120
the assumption that the internet would grow on an ability to make payments for things online and

443
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,240
that's why i you know i'm so bullish on on e-cash because it kind of finally gives us a very simple

444
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:08,200
way to to make payments online for services that we use online in a microscopic scale you need to be

445
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:14,580
able to pay like one cent or less than a cent for some things you need to be able to pay per second

446
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:22,200
if you don't want to rely on credit so if you want like a better access to a service and then be able

447
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,240
to use that immediately and the service provider can shut you down immediately if you don't pay

448
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,100
if you want that dynamic you need like a bear token that can move instantly for almost for free

449
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:39,280
and in any arbitrary amount that you want and like i'm so bullish about e-cash because in my mind it

450
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,500
opens this possibility of this new internet the internet kind of bifurcated in the 90s

451
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:52,680
when everyone thought that we are going to have a cyber economy and we will be able to finance all

452
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:58,360
these services from within we saw that no it's not going to happen it's not happening with credit

453
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:04,260
cards and people do not enter their kyc data into a form to make like a 10 cent i don't even i don't

454
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,940
even think that's the issue it is the 10 cent payment because it's impossible with credit cards

455
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,900
and so you have to batch payments because otherwise otherwise the counterparty risk kills you even the

456
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,720
10 cent payment must be a fake payment that's why every single subscription that you you'll ever see

457
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:23,180
online is like at least five bucks a month and it's mostly paid annually so that it's like 20 bucks

458
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,020
the bottom is dictated by the transaction fees of the entire system basically yeah or like the risk

459
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:33,480
inside the system exactly yeah so so it was impossible and just to interject for for a brief

460
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,660
moment but i think one of the guys who who wrote most kind of lucidly about this was uh i think um

461
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:46,240
the book's name is who owns the future and it was i think jared lanier he was very early on vr stuff as

462
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:54,040
well and he wrote about kind of um uh in the best case money flows through the whole internet and and

463
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,360
these kind of levies build up where we're just like wherever the value is provided like um that's

464
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,420
where the value will flow and his main criticism at the time was there was the book was written like

465
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,500
well over 10 years ago i i don't know exactly when but it's it's an old book in internet standards

466
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,580
and and he was one of the early critics of like the big players like facebook and those kind of

467
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:19,640
things where basically um there is lots of value provided but the whole value flows to one central

468
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:27,060
point and for i think he didn't know uh like you know big commie and so on he thought it was only for

469
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,520
for structural political reasons not for technical reasons i'm convinced it's mostly for for technical

470
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,860
reasons where you just you can't do it basically you can you cannot enter the space and become a

471
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:42,780
competition exactly like you will always end up with a monopoly if there was no one else can can

472
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:48,120
and also if there are any micro payments in the thing you still would have to kyc to receive payouts

473
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,060
and so on and so forth and it's like very high barrier to entry and it's like you get in the best

474
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:57,720
case you get facebook points like reddit karma you know and then to to pay like to actually exit the

475
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:04,700
system again you'll have to go through the whole you know kyc everything is so stupid yeah it's so

476
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:11,320
fucked like it's so fucked like if we continue on this path just think ahead like 10 years

477
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:18,280
is the is the is the realistic expectation that every person will have like 50 subscription at some

478
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,460
point yeah yeah that's the other thing is this how you're going to live on the internet you're you're

479
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:28,000
limited to only like 20 services because that's what you can pay for because you need like five

480
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,940
dollars minimum per month to be able to access them yeah it's like so stupid that's why i showed the

481
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,820
comic with like the pirate bay you know ah netflix comes around and it's like ah i don't need you

482
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:41,920
anymore and he puts away the pirate bay hat and then it's like netflix and disney plus and hulu

483
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,220
and youtube premium and whatnot and then like 10 years later he gets back into oh yeah my old

484
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:55,200
friend hello my dear old friend i made this i made this development myself so much like i'm so in love

485
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,740
with torrents right now and you know to resolve this issue to to really make sure that torrents can

486
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:06,120
survive forever which i think like i'm such a big fan of torrent for me it's like there are three

487
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,820
systems in the world that i think are really well done this is bitcoin torrent and nosta you know

488
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:18,700
torrent was there since the beginning and it will survive every nuclear disaster that we have like i love

489
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:25,620
it but torrent has no economics incentives built in that's the biggest weak point of torrents and when

490
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:32,660
i saw bitcoin for the first time a long time ago because also about the name overlap of bit torrent

491
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:38,040
and bitcoin i kind of automatically assumed that this will be used for online file sharing immediately

492
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:44,320
like it's just you know we're in the cyber world we have exchange of value in terms of data people

493
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:51,040
seed data people leech data and obviously like things cost money so let me just pay for for the data

494
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:57,320
that i download from you it's a very natural exchange basically as we all know we haven't

495
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:02,080
reached that point with bitcoin yet and that's due to technical reasons only like i'm convinced we would

496
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:07,220
we would see this already if we could make like micropayments with pure bitcoin and we can still do

497
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:12,120
it with lightning because we cannot force everyone to run to run a lightning note just to see it torrents

498
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:19,040
with ecash things look very different if we both share a mint then we can do micropayments for

499
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:24,360
for every kilobyte of data that you sent me i can send you like a satoshi and that's totally doable

500
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:31,280
and i i really hope that we will see this so it's also just again i'm i know i hate to interject but

501
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,420
it's also it's also about rate limiting because that's like every open system has this issue as well

502
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,860
and so it's not only about payments payments are a great way to rate limit stuff because the other

503
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:44,200
way to rate limit stuff is to kyc even if it's pseudonymous and so on it's like you have to create an

504
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,740
account and so on but it's like one one satoshi per whatever you know kilobyte or megabyte

505
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:54,060
don't pick your thing it's a fantastic way to rate limit yeah absolutely and like uh again lemma from

506
00:50:54,060 --> 00:51:00,040
that so either to rate limit someone either you need to know their identity so you can say like

507
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:07,600
this identity now you had enough stop doing that or if you want privacy which we all want then you

508
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:14,220
have no solution other than payments yeah right and that's that's so beautiful to see and satoshi

509
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,680
says that the signal actually says that to himself proof of work exactly that if you want a anonymous

510
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,840
system where everyone like an open set of people everyone can join and leave whenever they want they

511
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:30,900
do not have to register they have no identity then you must find a way to slow them down and the way

512
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,640
to slow them down is to make them pay and the only way to do it like internally inside cyberspace

513
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,860
without going out it's we all know it's compute it's proof of work and the funny thing is like

514
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:47,420
at the end of the day you would use like for example if you would use cashew for that is that

515
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:53,820
you you peg on the proof of work that has been provided earlier by some miner yeah by mining that

516
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:59,860
satoshi the real satoshi that is represented by that by that cashew token so you kind of only can

517
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:07,500
piggyback on real energy being spent and it's so clean yeah it's like almost the the universe giving

518
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:13,520
you a signal there's only one single way that we know of like there might be maybe another super

519
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:20,520
revolutionary idea but there's only like anonymous systems need proof of work which is bitcoin or you

520
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,620
have no anonymous system yeah yeah yeah that's that's also why like like from first principles

521
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:30,580
i think that's why also you can dismiss absolutely everything that doesn't have proof of work baked in

522
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:36,260
outright it's like all that's why once once i had this insight i just i was able to dismiss everything

523
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,680
else and if you if you look at the proof of work share yeah in the world it's like it's only bitcoin

524
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,840
so it's only bitcoin i reasoned myself into maximalism i did not absolutely i get that 100

525
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:53,120
percent and also proof of stake i think like proof of stake as an example as an alternative example

526
00:52:53,120 --> 00:53:00,420
to proof of work i'm like strongly convinced that this all these systems are like super unstable and

527
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:05,500
the reason why they are still around is because bitcoin is still around yeah like we see it all the time

528
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,260
take bitcoin out of the equation yeah all of that would collapse like it's funny because they kind

529
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:16,800
of you know in a hidden way yeah or not to mention they're hiding behind the shield kind of all hiding

530
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,800
behind that proof of work sheet of bitcoin no no absolutely but you see it with the with the

531
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:27,860
shittiest uh uh proof of stake systems with like i don't know like is it solana that restarts every

532
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:35,120
week and so on no but but there there's plenty that just have to kind of uh you know reset themselves

533
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,460
like every couple weeks and so on because they run into unresolvable conflicts and then you have to

534
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:45,480
ask a quorum which can't agree on what is right um like what is the actual state of the system and

535
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,340
you cannot know without proof of work you cannot know and then you just have to all right like this

536
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:55,120
is the checkpoint this is like we dictate now this is the actual state of the system and then we

537
00:53:55,120 --> 00:54:00,220
continue again and that's a political process of course and so so i mean everyone should know this

538
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:08,080
by now but but but basically the beauty of gold was to move the question of of um monetary policy

539
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,260
to the realm of physics yes away from the realm of politics to the realm of physics it's a kind of

540
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:19,020
like objectivism about what the state of a system is and yeah it removes humans from the equation can

541
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:25,060
only be based on physics yeah and bitcoin does the same thing just in cyberspace it it it it shifts the

542
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:31,820
question of monetary policy away from humans into physics so so physics dictates what the monetary

543
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:37,480
policy is and you can you know whatever you can be angry at you know physics as much as you want but

544
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:44,580
it's going to be no use don't be the angry man shouting at clouds yeah they won't shout back

545
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:54,880
so what would the internet look like if we were able to uh if we would have been able to build it

546
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:01,020
without without having to and i i kind of skipped over this fact before when i had my made my rant

547
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:07,200
about the bifurcation of the internet because the other path the world the path that we actually went

548
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,680
on was the monetization through advertisement through attention i would say yes attention exactly

549
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,820
attention attention is the currency yeah and advertisement is the way to to kind of monetize

550
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:27,140
that maybe yeah but um so that's what we ended up with the entire internet has now basically two modes

551
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:33,200
either you pay a subscription fee or you consume yeah ads or you pay with your eyeballs or you pay with

552
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:40,760
your eyeballs oh that's nice i i hope the listeners can hear the church bell ringing

553
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:47,040
mics will pick it up it's loud enough what do you think like what what what would we what would

554
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,000
the internet look like first of all for sure i'm sure that we wouldn't have this you know the world

555
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,100
that you're either a netflix subscriber or a disney plus subscriber and you know you just cannot

556
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:07,360
afford like five million different subscriptions so you must kind of become a separated folk from the

557
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:13,260
others like oh sorry i cannot watch that series because i i don't subscribe to that platform i i think

558
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,700
we would have less monopolies in general i think you know like going back to a very old book the

559
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:24,560
cathedral and the bazaar which talked about the ways to the different ways to develop software it was

560
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:32,420
like you know microsoft versus unix systems basically and i think the because we had to monetize

561
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:40,940
attention we kind of it favors monopolies it favors like you you you scale to like a half billion

562
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:46,740
users and then you're able to monetize and the the you know the user base is large enough that you

563
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:52,240
actually make money and then you squeeze them and then you do it all over again i think i think

564
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:58,380
it's not smart for us to go up that steep i think we'll just we'll just do a loop around all right

565
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:07,960
and can i have a look of just all right can i have a look again yeah sure we've been recording for one

566
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:14,300
hour oh okay good yes because as i told you after 90 minutes my brain is usually fried no we have 30

567
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:20,760
more minutes of your juicy brain to squeeze let's see let's see let's see you might need another coffee

568
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:28,860
i i will i will try this once just to just fuck it and just sit down and and go i i want to bring

569
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:35,960
someone to a shisha bar or something and just go really wild just record it all but anyway i i think

570
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:43,720
i think it would have evolved very differently and i think with the beauty to me of noser and and

571
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:49,840
with baked in e-cash right now is that it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter what you are you

572
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,380
can be a bot you can be a dog you can be a kid you can be from a sanctioned country whatever you

573
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:00,540
one click create a cryptographic identity and you immediately can receive money that's so

574
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:05,760
revolutionary like people it feels so not revolutionary but if you actually know what's

575
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:13,640
happening underneath like that's that is revolutionary and and if you allow people to make money things just

576
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:20,640
change very quickly things like i think i think because with the with the kind of current iteration

577
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:27,040
of the internet you the the barrier to receiving money is really high like you need a bank account

578
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,120
you need a credit line you need basically you need to be able to create a paypal account those kind of

579
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:37,380
things there's so many people that can't do that but absolutely anyone can you know like for example sign

580
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:42,400
up to all us and just receive saps immediately anyone can do that and so i think the internet would have

581
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,980
evolved very very differently just because of look at look at how the world works in general like

582
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:53,740
how many shops are in in this city there isn't only one there isn't just like one amazon that you go

583
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,880
to and you get everything there's like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of shops and there's people

584
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,220
like you know standing at street corners making money absolutely everywhere and we don't see this

585
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:08,320
we don't see this online yes without without cash you cannot like you cannot imagine a world where just

586
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:14,020
someone sets up a rogue store yeah that's why i use the lemonade sells sells there try to set up a

587
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:19,120
lemonade stand without without cash exactly it's it's it's impossible you'll have to fill out forms of

588
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:24,940
regulations and everything we will also lose that if we don't you know if we are not aware of what cash

589
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,700
brings us we will lose many of those nuances that we see right now and i think the same analogy

590
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:35,820
applies to the internet as well you have this you know media outlets crying out loud for years you know

591
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:42,560
oh like print media is dying no one buys stuff anymore and then they're begging for your credit card

592
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,720
number so you can like pay a little bit for the article that you're paying and at the same time you have

593
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:53,520
like customers when you do when you ask people like would you be able would you be willing to pay if you

594
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,020
could without any mental barriers like everyone says yes like of course i will pay like 10 cents

595
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,880
50 cents yeah but it's also i don't believe the customers in some way just like oh everyone will

596
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:09,980
buy the all natural uh buy a you know bio raised good meat chicken whatever and they just usually

597
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:16,240
don't they just usually don't it's like if you if if if you ask people they will tell you something

598
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:22,140
else and if they if you let them vote with their wallet they will behave very differently so so i would

599
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,820
be careful with that but i think also the mistake that the new york times and everyone is making

600
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:30,640
is they're trying to sell the wrong thing and i keep coming back to this i hate talking about the

601
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,880
fucking nft retards every single time but it's like you cannot sell a jpeg just like you cannot

602
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:41,160
sell a blog post there is no market that can form around a blog post because it's not this car's

603
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:46,720
thing so i think i think the people that that force you into these subscription models they are they're

604
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,180
trying to sell you the wrong thing well they can only do that because as you say there it doesn't have a

605
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:56,780
defined price you can just pick the price out of the yeah you have to make it up because there is

606
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:01,060
no supply and demand because i can take a screenshot of the blog post and send it to everyone for free

607
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:07,140
and so there is there is no like the supply is infinity and once one supply approaches infinity

608
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:11,400
market prices make no sense so they're selling the wrong thing and i think twitch figured that out for

609
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:16,540
example like twitch and like the streaming world and also to some extent the free-to-play games

610
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:21,100
figured that out what can you sell on twitch they are not selling the mp4 files they are not selling

611
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:25,160
access to the streams they're selling access to a community access to super chat and so on and i

612
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:29,480
think for journalism it could be the same way where it's like okay like maybe maybe you have tier

613
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,980
subscriptions and whatever but it's like you get access to the journalist you know and you get access

614
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,260
to whatever like was whatever was discussed in this thing and so on you you have to sell something that

615
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,800
is actually scarce and the blog post itself is not actually scarce and i feel like people are

616
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:49,420
insanely confused about this because they still try to sell blog posts and jpegs and mp4 files and so on

617
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:53,360
it's like oh i'm gonna build a youtube killer and it's like a paywall for every single video

618
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:59,340
it's like it it it does not work at all because also you're limiting the spread of the information

619
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:04,200
which is never a good idea you want to you you have to sell information wants to be free information

620
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,760
can be freely copied as well and and it's it's you have to sell something else and that's what

621
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,920
what i kind of want to that's why i keep harping on it because like almost everyone is still confused

622
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:20,420
about it and we see it already trending in a very different direction just because you it it like

623
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:26,320
everyone real like the market dictates that but we i think we can also if you know that beforehand

624
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:31,420
you can build something that you don't need like 25 iterations of until you land on something that

625
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:35,660
works like you can actually figure out what is cars in the first place and sell that but anyway

626
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:40,100
long round over no no explain this to me then like how this works with torrents because

627
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:46,080
like i would private trackers are scars yeah i would the trackers are scars it's not the files

628
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,760
the kilobytes and the things are not scars that doesn't mean that we shouldn't add e-cash to the

629
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,740
things because of the rate limiting issue and all those kind of things i but but that's not going

630
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:58,780
to be the you you it's very it's going to be very hard to have market dynamics around this and it's

631
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:04,020
also like metering everything doesn't necessarily make sense just because of mental transaction costs

632
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:07,760
that's why we have flat rates for everything that's why you get a flat rate for your gym and a flat

633
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:14,460
rate for your internet access and so on and and but um having high quality curation for example

634
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:20,760
that's something people should and could pay for it's like it's we see it with relays it's like we

635
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:28,500
have relays that are paid i assume because they are paid it's it's higher quality you know less spam

636
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:35,680
um higher availability all those kind of things and that's actually a service that is scarce and that's

637
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:42,600
worth paying for but you're not paying for you know like for the notes yeah you know but but

638
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:48,300
anyway like i'm trying to to to figure all these out again by by just picking the brains of of

639
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:53,520
everyone it's like figure out what is actually scarce in cyberspace and the easiest one of course is

640
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,560
compute and that's why i think i mean you we started uh talking about other lamps and so on and i think

641
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:05,380
that's why why why this is a match made in heaven like especially like e-cash and ai agents i think it's a

642
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:11,180
match made in heaven because you don't necessarily want to sign up for you know jet gbd or whatever

643
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:17,600
with your credit card and and you know like you i mean jet gbd obviously is what killed google no one

644
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,920
is using google anymore everyone is just like querying and and just like you know having a

645
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,580
conversation with their ai agent for absolutely everything with so paul you know like just like

646
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:32,440
coding is if you if you like learn to code is like a dad hashtag because you have to learn learn to

647
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:39,140
prompt i really want to i really want to see us go down that road because as we said before the

648
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:43,960
question of hardware and like hardware is inherently scarce because it's physical

649
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:50,120
anything physical is inherently scarce there is nothing physical that is not scarce yeah in a sense

650
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:54,400
like you can say yeah molecules there are enough air molecules for everyone but it's not an infinite

651
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:01,600
amount of air molecules and i don't know maybe in a dystopian uh world war three situation the

652
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:08,140
submarine you might have to pay for the oxygen as well exactly so uh that's really why where i want to

653
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:15,100
see us and i think like that would set us on a path of so much more freedom if we could create

654
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:23,200
markets for hardware-based services on the internet that starts with an isp but i think the more generic

655
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:32,020
form of it is compute as you said if we you know if we could even dream of a world where we do not

656
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:39,000
have to rely on gigantic centralized super clusters of compute that are controlled by a small amount

657
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,620
of companies but where we can actually have a market on-demand market where everyone could pay for

658
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:53,320
the resources that they that they use for that specific purpose and you know compute is universal

659
01:05:53,320 --> 01:06:00,280
you could do ai with the same hardware you could you know do all sorts of different different ai

660
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:06,020
models on it you could mine bitcoin with the same hardware and you know who knows what in in the future

661
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:11,580
because the hardware itself a general purpose and yeah i mean in some sense that's what airbnb

662
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:17,320
uh figured out and same for uber it's like okay to pick all the hotels in the world world which are

663
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:22,700
like that like in our analogy now the big data centers the big compute super clusters there is many

664
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:27,660
hotels and there's big hotels but take all the you know living rooms of all the people in the world

665
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:32,500
there's way more of those and so so switching to that like in some other areas that already happened

666
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:39,180
and and uh i think you know if you actually allow people to make money with their living room

667
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:43,740
they will rent it out and they will make money and it will proliferate so we see this that is work

668
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:48,120
same for uber and and everything else you know like most people have cars and so on and they don't

669
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:53,780
need it all the time so same for graphics cards and same for hard disks and everything and and so you

670
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:59,920
just need to be able to to pay for that and build a system that actually scales and scales in a trustless

671
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:06,840
manner basically yes and so uber unlocked this because um it was the apps that kind of unlocked this

672
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:13,100
like the missing link for that uber success story was our phones and the applications that connect us

673
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:19,720
yeah but and they were able to build this empire um while still being like the centralized party in

674
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:25,420
between navigating yeah everyone from from and to yeah and also the the payments going through them

675
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:31,200
yeah like payments existed before uber and then the apps came and connected everyone online now

676
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,460
everyone could use these services and boom you have like the biggest taxi service in the world

677
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:42,380
doesn't own a taxi yeah right so um if we think this one step further and we want to get rid of uber

678
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:46,280
at that point i mean again this is already happening i think like because then you have competition and

679
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,740
you have the same thing happen that happened to netflix where it's like 15 other things pop up and

680
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:53,680
then everyone hates it again because you actually want the stuff that interrupts and you don't want

681
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,920
to be locked in one silo and uber is a silo yeah uber is a silo and we can replace uber with nostr

682
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:04,500
yeah we we don't need the company in between that tells you what you can rent and what you cannot

683
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:11,000
rent but you would still you know without bitcoin you still couldn't do it because uber uber depends

684
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,800
on the credit card system all the payments need to go through uber and otherwise it's not possible

685
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:21,480
like with the right combination especially for compute you can't do it because because the more

686
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:28,920
micro something get the more the smaller the the kind of um yes the smaller the packets so to speak

687
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,300
that you want to sell uh are the harder it's going to be on credit rails that's why you need like an

688
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:38,800
instant payment system that is better absolutely and you want to pay for uh one second of compute

689
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:43,220
you want to be able to a single second of compute and once you stop paying you just turn off the

690
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:48,280
computer and i think the last step that's missing and that's coming now is blinded compute

691
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:53,780
and i think that's gonna be that's gonna be fantastic because that's we know that this

692
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:58,820
already works like again coming back to the torrents like people exactly even without payment people are

693
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:04,360
seeding torrents even without payment people ran sati at home and we're trying to search for

694
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,640
extraterrestrial life and or do protein folding and all those kind of things yes but what about the

695
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,960
risk of storing someone's data on your hard drive right yes and do you really want to go that risk

696
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,760
i don't know but if you cannot decrypt the data that is stored on your hard drive then you're fine

697
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:25,360
yeah so blinded compute and uh especially for ai i mean it's a two-sided coin again it's good for

698
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:29,880
privacy for the individual user but again also for the service provider you cannot become a service

699
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:35,220
provider if you don't like have a huge team of lawyers protecting yourself or being a company with

700
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:40,720
the resources of that but once you cannot look into what's happening the risk basically goes to zero

701
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,360
there is nothing you could have done and nothing you can be coerced to

702
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:51,840
yeah and i how how far along do you think are we i i i know that you know a little bit about the

703
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:56,780
you know zero knowledge compute stuff and all those kind of things i know very very little uh the only

704
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:04,040
thing that i know is that a lot of you know very smart people are currently looking into this working

705
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:10,920
on this and also trying to wet this stuff with nostr dvms yeah which i think is going to be

706
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:17,380
quite oh i think i think zero knowledge computation is going to be like the you know the next thing

707
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:25,380
it's like what we have with bitcoin and what it feels like is happening now with ai i think the next

708
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:31,640
step looking like 10 years ahead or something is going to be zero knowledge compute because it it's a

709
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:38,420
whole new paradigm of compute it basically like a summary is you can make computations on a machine

710
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:43,380
where the machine itself doesn't know what's being computed and this sounds like but you can prove

711
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:48,380
that it's right right you can prove that it's right and you can do crazy things with it like one

712
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:56,780
thing that for example i i can imagine us seeing at some point is you know you can make unruggable

713
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:03,040
compute in a sense you can pay for someone to calculate something for you but you know that they

714
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,280
couldn't have manipulated the calculation yeah and that's like a very very important point especially

715
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:13,300
if you want to rely on these services right so you cannot let's say i don't know which is what we

716
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:17,040
already use on the nostril and the bitcoin side just with cryptographic signatures basically you know

717
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:22,480
that you you yes but that's the static data yeah yeah exactly you can attest to the to the static

718
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:27,920
data that comes from the same from the correct source and hasn't been tampered with but how that data was

719
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,660
computed we cannot prove that yet yeah so with zero knowledge compute like i just want to make an

720
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:38,460
example with uh with what we are looking into for cashier right now so in cashier we have i hope

721
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:43,240
this is not too technical we have like spending conditions in cashier so it's it's similar to a

722
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:49,440
bitcoin spending condition so uh i pay you a coin and you can only you can only withdraw that coin or

723
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:56,120
receive that coin if you know the uh the result of a secret like of a riddle for example you have to

724
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:00,780
for example sign it with your private key or something like that yeah so that's how that's

725
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:05,600
also how you can lock e-cash to an endpub right exactly like we call that pay to public key and we

726
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,920
have another spending condition which is called an htlc a hash time lock contract it works the same way

727
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,960
as an htlc in bitcoin so you can only spend the coin if you know the pre-image to a hash or after a

728
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,160
time lock you can withdraw it so we have two different spending conditions in in cashier and people

729
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,880
always ask us like hey can we not add a third one and this idea and that idea and like all these cool

730
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,880
ideas of how to make more spending conditions but we have the problem in cashier that we want

731
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:36,460
incredible privacy so the more ways you add to spend the coin the worse the privacy for everyone

732
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:42,780
else becomes you make the unknown sets smaller and smaller because the mint needs to execute the

733
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:47,560
spending condition and so it needs to see the spending condition so like it's a complicated way

734
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:53,520
of saying if the two of us have a contract of how to spend a coin we need to show the mint the

735
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,300
contract and your signature for example on top of that and the mint would look at the contract and

736
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:04,100
see like public key a public key b and time log and blah blah blah okay it's valid you can get the

737
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:10,040
coin right so that's how it works today with a what we've been looking into is a zero knowledge

738
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:17,320
spending condition and this is this is based on work by people at startware who have built a vm called

739
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:25,900
cairo and in cairo cairo is a vm in which you can build uh spending conditions or programs in zero

740
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:32,820
knowledge what that means is that you write normal code and you can then execute this code and while

741
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:39,080
executing you can also produce a proof that you have correctly executed the code so basically i could

742
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:44,280
give you the proof after executing the program i could give you the proof without showing you the

743
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:48,800
program i can prove to you that i have executed it correctly yeah yeah and like that's the magic

744
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:55,180
point so getting back to cashew what we want want to see at at some point is a spending condition that

745
01:13:55,180 --> 01:14:01,500
is zero knowledge so that you and me can make a contract and you can say like i want a signature

746
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:06,780
from this public key i want time to has passed until this point and so on and so forth i want the moon

747
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:13,140
to be in a special position and the weather in in madeira to be this and that degree like all these

748
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:18,400
different uh variables inside there which make it a very specific spending condition which means it's

749
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:24,080
very bad for privacy if we would release this spending condition to the mint and what what you

750
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:29,540
can do instead with zero knowledge compute is we can agree on that very complicated contract you and me

751
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:36,100
and then we can put it into cairo and produce a proof that we have correctly executed the proof and now we

752
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:42,300
can go to the mint and say hey mint me and this other user have come to an agreement of a certain

753
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,760
contract and we are not going to show you the contract but we're just going to show you that

754
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:51,320
we have correctly executed the contract without even telling you what the specific details are

755
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,780
and the mint can then verify this proof and say okay you guys seem to agree so you can make the

756
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:03,640
transaction so this is one example of how you can make a computation applied to cashew where we don't

757
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:10,500
have to tell the the verifier which is in this case the mint what we actually did so coming back to

758
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:17,960
the earlier example if i could rent a piece of compute from a server and i could just tell it

759
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:26,180
you know i want to compute uh some kind of operation on my data set that is like a for example it's a

760
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:29,780
secret data set i'm a company with secrets or something like that i don't want to share the

761
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:36,460
data set but i still want you to make a computation on the data set i could give that to you in a form

762
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:42,480
that is hidden so it's this is called you know sometimes homomorphic encryption but you can do

763
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:49,140
operations on that and give me the results and i can verify that you've done the correct operations

764
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:55,400
on top of it without me ever showing you what the data was yeah so i know this all sounds a bit weird

765
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:01,980
and crazy and zero knowledge proofs are weird and crazy but they open up a whole new world of

766
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:08,080
computation so i want to end this monologue with one vision that i really want to see in like 10

767
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:16,920
years is we today rely on hardware security modules to make sure that our hardware has not been

768
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,700
tempered with this is in bitcoin hardware wallace this is sometimes also in phones these days and so

769
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:29,760
on so forth i can see a future where we carry a phone in our pocket that runs the os in a zero

770
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:38,360
knowledge vm and at the same time produces a proof that the vm executed the code of the os correctly

771
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:43,740
and some other part of it that checks this so we can look in the moment where someone tampers with

772
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:50,060
your phone you can immediately detect that something has gone wrong without relying on specific hardware

773
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:54,860
that again relies on the fact that no one can look into the hardware like a hardware security module

774
01:16:54,860 --> 01:17:03,460
so yeah zero knowledge is definitely going to have like a massive effect on things how we can prove

775
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:08,880
things in cyberspace without showing what we prove which is a condition for most of the things that we

776
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:14,080
want to that we want to do like we have so much private data and we need to operate on the private data

777
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,560
but we don't want to share it with anyone you think 10 years is a realistic time frame

778
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:25,360
i mean you usually underestimate how fast things go into the future so it's probably it's probably even

779
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:30,980
too bearish to be honest it's probably too bearish that's a good point yeah that's a good point it's

780
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:38,020
especially now with uh i really feel that stuff is accelerating um in in terms of kind of also

781
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:44,140
compute innovation in some sense i think the llms are just kind of you know um kicking things into

782
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:50,980
high gear because you can just iterate so much more quickly in on so many things and i mean material

783
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:54,840
science is another or i mentioned protein folding before you know it's just like you throw the llms

784
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:00,140
on it and suddenly it's like oh okay we have new stuff and a new material that we can synthesize that

785
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:05,700
is stable or like new proteins and i view code as the same way where it's just like you you shoot the llms

786
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:10,620
at it and and something comes out that you after the fact maybe understand basically

787
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:17,180
and that will just accelerate stuff things are going freaking exponential yeah yeah it's it's uh

788
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:25,260
you know i was big on the on the singularity idea uh um in my past and and oh yeah me too and

789
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:30,400
you know like kurzweil and those people they were onto something i still don't think that we're gonna

790
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:35,660
upload ourselves into the cloud and you know live in utopia ever after in cyberspace like not at all

791
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:43,820
and i'm not optimistic but i i think yes i would also bet on the fact that he will die

792
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:51,620
but um you know big innovations happen stepwise it's so hard to predict what's going to happen

793
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:57,660
no one would have thought you know i've just recently saw this video about uh the number of

794
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:03,820
proteins that we have identified and this was a tedious process and people were like building

795
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:09,180
algorithms to predict the folding structure of proteins for years and years and we had like

796
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:13,740
one thousand per year and then we had like maybe like one thousand five hundred it was an exponential

797
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:21,660
two thousand per year and then um we built an llm that can do it and the number of of identified

798
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:27,260
proteins just shot up like by i don't know it's like you don't even see the graph anymore

799
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:31,420
of all the proteins when you hit the knee of the curve right it's like it goes up and up and

800
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:36,220
the problem is solved and this was with with the genome as well so hard to predict so hard to

801
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:42,060
predict real innovation comes in unpredictable steps yeah so we really don't know how things

802
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:47,740
will work out but but it's still like a lot of the things that's kind of what what surprises me

803
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:53,900
all the time it's also very hard to predict like what yeah just again it's it's i love the phrase

804
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:59,900
it's very hard to make predictions especially about the future you know um but for example the switch

805
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:10,140
from ip4 ipv4 to ipv6 is still you know like far off from done like like upgrading a network it

806
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:17,100
it turns out it's like really hard and and so it's funny that some things happen really quickly

807
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:23,820
way more quickly than you would think they would and other things way like take way longer or even

808
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:32,220
to pick another example um that might be actually a good a good analogy like in in in developing

809
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:39,660
countries they completely skipped the infrastructure that we needed to arrive at cell phones so we needed

810
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:47,260
you know like copper wires and then uh you know like the landlines yeah exactly and and i think like to

811
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:55,500
bring it back to to to lightning and e-cash and so on it's like if if our assumptions are correct

812
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:01,820
and e-cash will actually uh be the thing that you know fixes 402 and and and allows all these things

813
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:07,900
to happen that we just kind of sketched out i think in a lot of systems and areas not only geographically

814
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:13,980
geographic areas but just like cyberspace areas you can just use e-cash without knowing anything about

815
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:17,260
bitcoin or lightning or whatever it's like you know like maybe you know a little bit about

816
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,540
lightning if you're running mint but that's it but you can just build it into your thing

817
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:26,700
leapfrogging all this stuff and just like in a in a developing country you have a phone and that's it

818
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:31,420
you have e-cash and that's it does that make sense yes it makes sense and we need to find like

819
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:37,660
more ways how we can accelerate the exponential growth and the use of bitcoin at the end of the day

820
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:43,580
i think like i've been observing the development and spreading of bitcoin really eagerly

821
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:50,540
in the past years and it is slower than most people anticipated that's for sure like most

822
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:54,700
people thought that we'd be paying for most like you would have the option to pay with bitcoin

823
01:21:55,740 --> 01:22:02,380
everywhere by this time it's very local it's it's very local it's very hard and similar to hardware

824
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:09,740
and networks as you said it grows much slower than people thought yeah because you have to upgrade the

825
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:15,100
network of merchants basically so merchant adoption uh that was the first kind of you know like uh

826
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:21,660
the scam kind of wave of bitcoin adoption oh it's all the merchants but but but i think the the current

827
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:27,180
wave is very different because the most people that um i mean i know a little bit about this stuff

828
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:34,300
just by being in places where bitcoin is accepted most merchants they hold all the bitcoin so the previous

829
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:39,900
adoption waves were always like as used as a payment rail and now it's kind of uh used as a

830
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:46,620
you know savings yeah so that's a big difference i feel like so i think it won't go away should we do

831
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:50,940
one more ring around the rosie and then we can end in like a maybe a spot where there isn't too much

832
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:56,140
wind sounds good yeah that's but i'm i'm getting close to my limit in terms of i think it's just walking

833
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:05,100
in the sun also like i'm at the end of my mental capabilities but i think just being in the sun

834
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:12,460
makes it worse it makes thinking even harder but it's nice right so that is a pretty butterfly

835
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:17,180
yeah look at this butterfly oh wow that's what she said but there was a lady who just made us aware

836
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:24,540
of a beautiful butterfly butterflies are rare these days but yeah i i hope that nostr will accelerate

837
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:30,620
things in some way but that's that's what i kind of i mean i'm very biased i know that i'm i'm

838
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:36,460
insanely biased i'm kind of like in a bubble of a bubble i surround myself with with like i pick my

839
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:43,020
i curate my echo chamber very very very carefully and i live in a very bubbly place as well but it's

840
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:48,380
the way i see it is like i i met a bunch of people now and i know people from online they had no idea

841
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:53,420
about bitcoin had no idea about lightning didn't know what sets were signed up to nostr got sapped and it

842
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:58,300
was fun and cool and so on and then later on they found out what's kind of going on and what happened

843
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:03,580
and so on and i think i hope that this will continue to happen where you just you you sign up to obscura

844
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,740
and and you just you just want to get a vpn and there's a new thing of payment whatever you just do

845
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:11,900
it ah i can do this and then that's on you don't even know what what happened i see the same thing

846
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:17,420
happening now with with nostr with things like olas i really love it like people sign up to olas

847
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:22,140
because they want to try this thing and then they know oh my god there's a whole universe attached to

848
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:26,380
your olas that i didn't know about or you didn't have to know about and that's how kind of the

849
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:31,500
internet worked right that's why why i to me nostr feels so much like the early internet where you

850
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:36,620
have one entry point and it was i don't know what it was back in the day but just i mean i i still

851
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:41,980
remember the days where i would go through computer magazines and i would manually write down urls so

852
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:46,940
you're like oh my it's not only aol i thought it's just the start page of aol

853
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:54,860
and then you you discover this is this vast universe of stuff so now we live in an echo chamber okay but

854
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:59,580
it feels like to me still that the topics that we care about are universal it's not like small topics

855
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:06,220
that we care about we we care about the bigger bigger things so and that's where like it all comes

856
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:12,380
together so nicely i really think we're getting back to bitcoin adoption as well merchant adoption

857
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:18,060
is slow individuals understanding bitcoin is super slow education itself is like super slow

858
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:24,700
and i applaud everyone who puts their energy into into these endeavors i really really respect that

859
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:34,140
but what i really hope to see and this was my first thought when i discovered bitcoin is i thought

860
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:40,300
it's the perfect thing for the internet the money of the internet it's the internet's own money and so

861
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:47,980
what i want to see in 10 15 20 years us doing is for all of our activity where we make transactions

862
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:53,820
online there is no question it's going to be bitcoin it's going to be based on bitcoin and it's going

863
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:59,100
to be so much larger than the payments that you make at the store here and it's going to spread so much

864
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:05,020
faster than the merchants accepting bitcoin in a pos system in a store here these are all important

865
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:11,100
things that we also need to work on but the internet is only going to grow the number of people

866
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:16,540
using the internet is only going to grow the services that you're going to consume the number of services

867
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:23,020
only going to grow all of these things just point completely upwards and what we need to make sure

868
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:29,340
is that we can connect all these things with a system like nostra and make sure that we can pay

869
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:35,580
with for all these things with a system like bitcoin and then it's like the sky is the limit it's the

870
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:43,420
the pie is so big the pie is so big the only ones eating the pie right now are facebook meta and like

871
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:49,340
credit card systems what do you see what do you see as the next step because i i i completely agree but i i

872
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:58,300
kind of what i what i uh sometimes wreck my brain about is what's the the next plausible step that

873
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:03,980
we could take that someone could build that someone could do like on a general level i have like i

874
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:09,020
cannot give you like an idea for a specific app or something but on a general level i think we need to

875
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:16,220
bring down the cost of entry for everything as soon as someone just automatically can join these systems

876
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:21,740
and naturally receive naturally have an identity that they connect with other applications i think

877
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:26,460
like that's the best way we can do because that's our superpower we don't like the others don't have

878
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:31,980
the superpower they all they need to compete something only we can take away not saps for example

879
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:37,820
not saps is only something we can do yes that's not something that only we can do not saps is like a

880
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:44,300
zap on on on nostra with e-cash no one can build an alternative to this system and i think if we can

881
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:49,980
lower the barrier of entry such that you don't even have to spend a single cycle of your brain to be

882
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:55,100
able to use these systems this is how we're going to this is how we're going to win we we have to we

883
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:59,980
have to kind of you know get people where they're at i think that's why why olas for example works

884
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:05,500
really well because everyone knows kind of comparable systems like instagram and so on it's it's but

885
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:09,180
again like i mentioned this a couple of times in the past but it's like the the power that i see the

886
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:14,140
power of cryptographic identities is basically it's it's one click setup yes this is part of it you don't need to

887
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:19,100
make an account like why would you need one click you're in and the power of nuts apps you don't need

888
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:24,140
an account to receive cash on your in your store that you pop up exactly and the power of nuts apps

889
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:28,140
is like you you one click create your account and immediately like you you suddenly have money in

890
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:32,940
your in your in your pocket you can receive instantly and no one asks you who you are yeah now do this please

891
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:37,740
yeah eight billion people yeah no that's very very powerful so i'll share one of my ideas that i've been

892
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:43,580
stewing on for at least the last like six or ten months or so so as you might know the internet

893
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:50,140
archive almost went down just because of a lawsuit and and so so i would love to see

894
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:58,220
um i would love to see us rebuild the internet archive and do it properly so that this cannot

895
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:04,380
happen again we talked about this very very briefly over coffee that it's like it's funny how the

896
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:09,660
internet is both forever and the internet remembers everything but at the same time stuff goes away and

897
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:14,220
and links 404 and uh you have link rot and bit rot and all those kind of things so both are kind

898
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:18,780
of true at the same time i think if something is juicy and spicy enough the internet will remember

899
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:24,620
forever if something is kind of supposed to be forgotten yeah exactly if something is embarrassing

900
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:30,620
it will stay around forever and and and many other things but just just go away so we have like

901
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:36,220
little little fires of uh the library of alexandria like all the time you know stuff just goes away and

902
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:42,300
and i'm i'm i'm somewhat of an of an of an archivist so so i uh you know like i'm a

903
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:47,500
hunter and gatherer in cyberspace and i i really i i hate losing stuff

904
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:57,580
and so what the the shift that i see that i hope will happen in the next couple of years is not only a

905
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:05,260
move away from silos to you know uh to to bitcoin industrial to the underlying substrates that allow for

906
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:09,980
marketplace style of doing things um so i really hope that but again like

907
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:16,060
the issue i see right now it is related to what you said education and all those kind of things

908
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:20,540
because it doesn't come for free you have to take responsibility for it and so we have to also

909
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:26,220
educate users and and not everyone is going to make the jump because it actually you have to take

910
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:30,300
responsibility for at least for your keys for example and those kind of things so so it's not it's not

911
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:35,420
it's not like super super easy but it's still it increases your agency and i think that's why it

912
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,860
will happen on the edges like people that will get the platform people that will get the banked

913
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:45,020
and so on they will discover those things early on earlier than most but anyway i hope that we can

914
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:52,140
so the move that i see is from a global view and we see this like in in society at large where you

915
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:56,700
you know like uh think global act local those kind of things that people going back to their local

916
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:00,780
farmers and those kind of things and i hope that we'll have we'll have the same thing in cyberspace

917
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:08,700
in some in some sense um so so what i hope to see is the stuff that you really care about personally

918
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:16,460
you can archive it in a i hate this word i'm gonna use it anyway in a decentralized way

919
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:21,100
you can archive it on your home relay or on your like phone relay even or what have you

920
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:26,780
and that we have just kind of like there's a swarm of people just like we talked with with

921
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:32,460
airbnb and this kind of things like if you want to invite people into your house you can and you can

922
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:40,140
get paid if you want to invite websites and youtube videos and uh and songs into your local relay or

923
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:46,940
into your local blossom server or what have you you can and i think i think that's a way way smarter way of

924
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:52,220
of building an internet archive where you have local archives that can if they want to talk to

925
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:57,580
each other and that way i think we we we just kind of re-decentralize the internet in some way because

926
01:31:57,580 --> 01:32:02,700
i the reason why i work on all this stuff is like i just like you i really care about the internet

927
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:08,700
i'm still i i grew up with the utopic vision of the internet i i grew up with all that stuff and i

928
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:14,940
really think again i don't believe in utopia anymore i'm i'm too old for that but but i i still

929
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:20,140
think the internet is amazing and i i hate to see it go to shit and i think that what i see with

930
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:27,580
nostr is kind of like a a rebirth where where it aims for amazing again and to me like nostr feels

931
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:34,700
looks and feels amazing and and i i hope that like with the right ideas basically and with the right

932
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:39,980
principles and morals embedded in the whole thing i really think we can get one step closer to the

933
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:44,300
vision that the early internet people had it's again it's not going to be utopia again it's like and

934
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:48,780
there's going to be like terrible side effects and other things as well like i know that much

935
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:53,420
we learned so much i know that i know that stuff was going to be shit as well but still i i think i

936
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:59,740
think trying to to rebuild an internet archive for example would be would be an awesome next step

937
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:04,460
and then we can take things from there because everything shares the same architecture in some

938
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:09,100
sense like the the architecture is universal the principles are universal and it applies to so many

939
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:14,620
things and and also we see it now with journalism and and writing and so on i i one last tangent

940
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:20,220
and it's tangent after tangent but it's like the reason my books are so great is because books are

941
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:25,820
inherently decentralized it's like e-readers and so on are great too but but if you just pull your

942
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:30,380
stuff from amazon then it sucks because then it's just like one finger snip and and the book is gone

943
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:35,980
books are so great try to get rid of of books try to get rid of one single edition of a book if

944
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:40,380
there's like 10 000 copies and they're all over the world well good luck and it's crazy that we

945
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:44,940
have not achieved this in the digital realm yet it's it's insane right and you know we don't have

946
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:49,100
it inside space and there's anna's archive now yeah we have it with torrents and with some of the

947
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:53,980
single projects and like the cedars you can look at the statistics it's like one to two sources we

948
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:58,940
have the biggest sources of information that the world has ever produced we have this marvelous

949
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:03,820
technology of the internet that connects us all all our hardware all our resources yeah but we're

950
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:10,940
still at a point where like a single server basically can burn and we lose massive amounts

951
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:17,100
of information that humanity has produced until now we can still have alexandria moments we can

952
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,020
still have alexandria that's what we've been building we've been building libraries of alexandria for

953
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:26,300
everything yes and i really hope that we can get out of silos yeah and and so so that's why i'm a huge

954
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:31,100
fan of local copies and because because and there are these communities of people that know this you

955
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:35,580
know like there there are the people that build anna's archive and those kind of things there is

956
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:40,860
a group of people that knows this and they will store their files on their own hard disks and and

957
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:45,180
and periodically will make backups and put the hard disks in the bunkers that they have and so on you

958
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:50,540
know and so we i feel like we need to tap into those people and make this this style of dealing with

959
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:55,340
data way easier and it's the noster native way of doing things that's why i think the marriage of

960
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:59,740
noster and those kind of things is is so awesome because because in the end like i'll i mean i've

961
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:05,180
spoke about this a million times basically but i i feel like i'm a broken record but but the way

962
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:10,700
that youtube works youtube doesn't have one server if you if you're in germany and you fetch a youtube

963
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:15,500
video it will come from a german youtube server so so so so just to be efficient you have to build things

964
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:21,260
everyone knows that you have to build content delivery networks and and it has to be replicated and so on

965
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:27,900
and so noster does this by default yes and so so so you get so much for free in the noster world

966
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:32,460
where it's like you you maybe have a relay on your phone you maybe have a relay on your home server

967
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:37,660
maybe like a synology or start nine or what have you and depending on the context and depending on

968
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:42,220
what you care about stuff will be stored in this relay and i think what ecash brings to the table

969
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:46,380
what i'm so excited about is like okay let's build all up all these archives and we're like

970
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:50,540
beyond early with all this stuff we don't even have the archives really yet but make it easy to build

971
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:55,500
up local archives and if you share the underlying substrate and if things can talk to each other

972
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,940
which which they can by default if again if you build it right if you build it on noster and all

973
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:04,940
those kind of things you can by marrying it with ecash open it up and create a marketplace you can for

974
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:09,500
example create a marketplace for hashes you know you want this book you know you want this pdf you know

975
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:15,500
you want this meme whatever and and and who can give it to me fastest i'm willing to pay sets for it

976
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:20,860
all those kind of things you know and so so i really hope that we can we can we can you know

977
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:25,340
like learn from the mistakes of the past and stop building libraries of alexander it's so beautiful

978
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:33,420
like we we converge on this is the early values are still the most important values it's the distribution

979
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:41,100
of information it's the commerce between peer-to-peer commerce between people and making it's the knowledge

980
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:44,780
which that is embedded in the market and it's also net neutrality because zero knowledge compute

981
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:50,780
it is it is natural net neutrality in the same sense blinded custodians and blinded compute and

982
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:57,260
all those kind of things it it leads to neutrality neutrality of money yeah yes yeah that's a nice

983
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:02,540
that's a nice way to end it right yes it's a beautiful way to end it awesome let's let's build it out

984
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:08,380
